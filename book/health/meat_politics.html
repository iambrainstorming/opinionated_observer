<h2 id="meat-eating-by-early-humans"><a class="header" href="#meat-eating-by-early-humans">Meat eating by Early Humans</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/evidence-for-meat-eating-by-early-humans-103874273/">https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/evidence-for-meat-eating-by-early-humans-103874273/</a></p>
<p>The diet of the earliest hominins was probably somewhat similar to the diet of modern chimpanzees: omnivorous, including large quantities of fruit, leaves, flowers, bark, insects and meat.</p>
<h2 id="eating-meat-drove-the-evolution-of-our-big-powerful-brain"><a class="header" href="#eating-meat-drove-the-evolution-of-our-big-powerful-brain">Eating meat drove the evolution of our big, powerful brain</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nasw.org/article/eating-meat-drove-evolution-our-big-powerful-brain">https://www.nasw.org/article/eating-meat-drove-evolution-our-big-powerful-brain</a></p>
<p>The modern human brain is two to three times larger than that of our closest relatives, chimpanzees. But to supply energy to such metabolically demanding tissue, a distinct trade-off in energy allocation had to evolve.</p>
<p>In 1992, researchers proposed that this gradual expansion of the ancestral brain was made possible by switching from a vegetative diet to a meat-rich, fat-rich diet. As meat became a dietary staple, the gut shortened, and the brain no longer needed to rely on fuel from muscle and fat stores in the body. A shorter gut requires a great deal less energy than the lengthy gut of herbivores. Drawing on the extra energy resources from a fatty diet, and a shorter gut, the brain could afford to grow.</p>
<h2 id="how-a-vegan-diet-could-affect-your-intelligence"><a class="header" href="#how-a-vegan-diet-could-affect-your-intelligence">How a vegan diet could affect your intelligence</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200127-how-a-vegan-diet-could-affect-your-intelligence">https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200127-how-a-vegan-diet-could-affect-your-intelligence</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are several important brain nutrients that simply do not exist in plants or fungi</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creatine, carnosine, taurine, EPA and DHA omega-3 (the third kind can be found in plants), haem iron and vitamins B12 and D3 generally only occur naturally in foods derived from animal products, though they can be synthesised in the lab or extracted from non-animal sources such as algae, bacteria or lichen, and added to supplements.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the children who were given the soup containing meat each day seemed to have a significant edge. By the end of the study, they outperformed all the other children on a test for non-verbal reasoning. Along with the children who received soup with added oil, they also did the best on a test of arithmetic ability. Of course, more research is needed to verify if this effect is real, and if it would also apply to adults in developed countries, too. But it does raise intriguing questions about whether veganism could be holding some people back.</p>
<h2 id="meat-and-climate-change"><a class="header" href="#meat-and-climate-change">Meat and climate change</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/food">https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/food</a></p>
<p>Which foods cause the most greenhouse gas emissions?</p>
<p>Animal-based foods, especially red meat, dairy, and farmed shrimp, are generally associated with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. </p>
<p>Meat production often requires extensive grasslands, which is often created by cutting down trees, releasing carbon dioxide stored in forests.</p>
<h2 id="high-meat-consumption-linked-to-obesity"><a class="header" href="#high-meat-consumption-linked-to-obesity">High Meat Consumption Linked to Obesity</a></h2>
<p>Several studies have found a positive correlation between high meat consumption and obesity. For example, a study published in the International Journal of Obesity found that individuals who consumed high amounts of meat had a 33% higher risk of central obesity compared to those who consumed less meat.</p>
<p><a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2009/wang-meat-consumption-obesity">Diets High in Meat Consumption Associated with Obesity</a></p>
<p>Moreover, a diet high in meat may also lack essential nutrients found in plant-based foods, such as fiber, vitamins, and minerals, which are essential for maintaining a healthy weight and preventing chronic diseases. A balanced diet should include a variety of foods from all food groups, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats, to ensure that all necessary nutrients are obtained.</p>
<h2 id="the-cultural-significance-of-meat-consumption"><a class="header" href="#the-cultural-significance-of-meat-consumption">The Cultural Significance of Meat Consumption</a></h2>
<p>Meat consumption is not just a biological necessity; it is also an essential part of many cultural practices. In many societies, meat is a symbol of wealth, power, and status. For instance, in many African cultures, meat is considered a delicacy and is served during special occasions and ceremonies. Similarly, in many Indigenous cultures, hunting and meat consumption are integral to their cultural identity and way of life.</p>
<p>Therefore, the cultural significance of meat consumption cannot be ignored. Attempts to impose vegetarianism or veganism on people who have deep-rooted cultural connections to meat consumption can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism. Instead, we should focus on promoting responsible meat consumption that takes into account the cultural practices and beliefs of different communities.</p>
<h2 id="animal-sacrifice-and-superstition"><a class="header" href="#animal-sacrifice-and-superstition">Animal Sacrifice and Superstition</a></h2>
<p>While meat consumption can offer numerous health benefits and has played a significant role in human evolution, it is crucial to distinguish between its use as a source of nutrition and its involvement in animal sacrifice and superstition.</p>
<p>The practice of animal sacrifice, however, raises concerns about animal welfare and can perpetuate a culture of violence and disregard for the sanctity of life.</p>
<p>Superstition, on the other hand, involves the belief in supernatural influences and the attribution of events to causes that have no logical explanation. When it comes to meat consumption, superstition can lead to misguided beliefs and practices that may pose a danger to both human and animal health.</p>
<p>In some underdeveloped communities, the belief in supernatural forces and the need to appease these entities can result in horrific acts of violence, including the sacrifice of human lives.</p>
<p>The persistence of misguided beliefs and practices, such as animal sacrifice, serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers that can arise from the intersection of superstition and human behavior. In some underdeveloped communities, the belief in supernatural forces and the need to appease these entities can result in horrific acts of violence, including the sacrifice of human lives.</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-personal-choice"><a class="header" href="#the-importance-of-personal-choice">The Importance of Personal Choice</a></h2>
<p>The decision to consume meat or abstain from it is a deeply personal one that should be based on individual preferences, beliefs, and cultural practices. Imposing vegetarianism or veganism on people based on religious grounds can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism that undermines the agency of individuals to make their own choices. Moreover, it can lead to a sense of alienation and exclusion among those who do not adhere to the prescribed dietary practices.</p>
<p>Religious indoctrination to quit meat can also lead to conflicts within families and communities, especially in cultures where meat consumption is an essential part of social and cultural practices. For instance, in many Hindu households, meat is served during special occasions and festivals, and abstaining from it can be seen as a rejection of cultural traditions and practices.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>The debate surrounding meat politics has become increasingly polarized, with advocates for vegetarianism and veganism on one side and those who support responsible meat consumption on the other. While it is essential to consider the environmental impact of meat production and consumption, it is equally important to recognize the historical, evolutionary, and health benefits of meat consumption.</p>
