<p>In the realm of jurisprudence, judges hold an esteemed responsibility of upholding justice, protecting fundamental rights, and ensuring equality for all individuals. Central to this responsibility is the imperative for judges to base their judgments on objective criteria, free from personal biases and opinions.</p>
<p>Fundamental rights, enshrined in constitutions around the world, serve as the bedrock of a just and equitable society. These rights encompass a wide array of liberties, including freedom of speech, the right to privacy, and equality before the law. It is the duty of judges to safeguard these rights zealously, employing a balanced approach that respects both individual freedoms and societal interests.</p>
<p>In the pursuit of justice, scientific evidence plays a pivotal role. Whether in criminal trials, environmental disputes, or matters of public health, scientific findings can provide crucial insights that inform legal proceedings. From DNA analysis to climate change research, the integration of scientific evidence enables judges to make well-informed decisions grounded in empirical data rather than conjecture or speculation.</p>
<p>Moreover, in a world grappling with complex ethical dilemmas and social injustices, the concept of constitutional morality emerges as a guiding principle for judicial interpretation. Constitutional morality refers to an adherence to the spirit and values enshrined in the constitution, transcending mere legal formalism. It encompasses notions of justice, fairness, and human dignity, serving as a compass to navigate the intricacies of legal disputes.</p>
<p>However, the effective integration of scientific evidence and constitutional morality into judicial decisions requires a steadfast commitment to impartiality and objectivity. Judges must remain vigilant against the influence of personal biases and ideological predispositions that may cloud their judgment. The judiciary's credibility hinges on its ability to <strong>dispense justice without fear or favor</strong>, ensuring that all individuals are treated equitably before the law.</p>
<p>Furthermore, judicial education and training programs play a vital role in equipping judges with the requisite knowledge and skills to grapple with complex scientific concepts and constitutional principles. Continuing education initiatives focused on scientific literacy and constitutional jurisprudence can empower judges to adjudicate cases effectively, safeguarding fundamental rights while promoting societal welfare.</p>
<p>In addition to judicial competence, transparency and accountability mechanisms are essential to uphold the integrity of the judiciary. Public scrutiny and oversight serve as checks against judicial misconduct or partiality, fostering trust and confidence in the legal system.</p>

<h3 id="the-crucial-role-of-interdisciplinary-knowledge-in-judicial-decision-making"><a class="header" href="#the-crucial-role-of-interdisciplinary-knowledge-in-judicial-decision-making">The Crucial Role of Interdisciplinary Knowledge in Judicial Decision Making</a></h3>
<h4 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h4>
<p>Judges play a pivotal role in the administration of justice. Their decisions have far-reaching consequences, not only for the parties involved in a particular case but also for society as a whole. It is, therefore, essential that judges are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to make informed, fair, and just decisions. While a thorough understanding of the law is undoubtedly essential, it is increasingly evident that judges also need to be well-versed in interdisciplinary knowledge to navigate the complexities of modern society effectively.</p>
<h4 id="the-importance-of-interdisciplinary-knowledge-in-judicial-decision-making"><a class="header" href="#the-importance-of-interdisciplinary-knowledge-in-judicial-decision-making">The Importance of Interdisciplinary Knowledge in Judicial Decision Making</a></h4>
<p>In today's fast-paced, technologically advanced world, the issues that come before the courts are becoming increasingly complex. Many of these issues require an understanding of scientific principles, methods, and findings to be properly evaluated and resolved. For example, cases involving environmental pollution, medical malpractice, or intellectual property disputes often hinge on scientific evidence.</p>
<p>As a result, judges must be able to understand and evaluate this evidence effectively. This requires a solid foundation in the relevant scientific disciplines, such as physics, chemistry, biology, and molecular biology. A judge who lacks this knowledge may struggle to grasp the implications of scientific evidence, leading to flawed decisions that fail to provide justice for the parties involved.</p>
<p>Moreover, an understanding of scientific methods and experimentation is crucial for evaluating the credibility of scientific evidence. Judges must be able to assess whether the methods used to generate the evidence were reliable, valid, and free from bias. Without this knowledge, judges may inadvertently admit unreliable or invalid evidence, which can lead to miscarriages of justice.</p>
<h4 id="the-role-of-neuroscience-and-logical-fallacies-in-judicial-decision-making"><a class="header" href="#the-role-of-neuroscience-and-logical-fallacies-in-judicial-decision-making">The Role of Neuroscience and Logical Fallacies in Judicial Decision Making</a></h4>
<p>Another area in which interdisciplinary knowledge can be invaluable for judges is neuroscience. A growing body of research in this field has shed light on the workings of the human brain, including how it processes information, makes decisions, and forms beliefs. This knowledge can help judges to better understand the cognitive biases and heuristics that may influence their decision-making processes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Questions like 'Does free will exist?' or 'What makes a criminal commit a crime?' can be answered by shedding light on neuroscience, molecular biology, and evolution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neuroscientific research has revealed that our thoughts and actions are the result of complex neural processes that occur within the brain. For instance, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that different regions of the brain are activated when we make decisions, suggesting that our choices are not entirely arbitrary but rather influenced by our neural architecture.</p>
<p>Moreover, molecular biology research has identified specific genes and proteins that play a role in decision-making processes. For example, certain genetic mutations have been linked to impulsive behavior, indicating that our genetic makeup can influence our choices.</p>
<p>For example, judges may be susceptible to the confirmation bias, which is the tendency to seek out and interpret information in a way that confirms their existing beliefs. By understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying this bias, judges can take steps to mitigate its influence on their decision making.</p>
<p>Similarly, an understanding of logical fallacies can help judges to identify and avoid common errors in reasoning that can lead to flawed decisions. For instance, the ad hominem fallacy involves attacking the person making an argument rather than the argument itself. By recognizing this fallacy, judges can ensure that their decisions are based on the merits of the case, rather than personal biases or prejudices.</p>
<h4 id="the-benefits-of-interdisciplinary-knowledge-for-judicial-decision-making"><a class="header" href="#the-benefits-of-interdisciplinary-knowledge-for-judicial-decision-making">The Benefits of Interdisciplinary Knowledge for Judicial Decision Making</a></h4>
<p>The benefits of interdisciplinary knowledge for judges are manifold. First and foremost, it enables judges to make more informed, evidence-based decisions that are grounded in a thorough understanding of the issues at hand. This, in turn, can lead to more just and equitable outcomes for the parties involved in a case.</p>
<p>Moreover, an interdisciplinary approach to judicial decision making can help to bridge the gap between law and science, fostering greater collaboration and cooperation between these two fields. This can lead to the development of new legal frameworks and policies that are better suited to addressing the complex challenges of the modern world.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h4>
<p>In conclusion, while a solid understanding of the law is essential for judges, it is not enough to ensure just and fair decisions. Judges must also be well-versed in interdisciplinary knowledge, including physics, chemistry, biology, molecular biology, neuroscience, scientific methods, experimentation, logical fallacies, and paradoxes. By acquiring this knowledge, judges can better navigate the complexities of modern society, making more informed, evidence-based decisions that provide better social justice for all.</p>

<h3 id="undergrounding"><a class="header" href="#undergrounding">Undergrounding</a></h3>
<p>In civil engineering, undergrounding is the replacement of overhead cables providing electrical power or telecommunications, with underground cables. It helps in wildfire prevention and in making the power lines less susceptible to outages during high winds, thunderstorms or heavy snow or ice storms. An added benefit of undergrounding is the aesthetic quality of the landscape without the powerlines. Undergrounding can increase the capital cost of electric power transmission and distribution but may decrease operating costs over the lifetime of the cables.</p>
<p>Underground cables pose no hazard to low-flying aircraft or to wildlife.</p>
<p>Above-ground lines cost around $10 per 1-foot (0.30 m) and underground lines cost in the range of $20 to $40 per 1-foot (0.30 m). In highly urbanized areas, the cost of underground transmission can be 10–14 times as expensive as overhead. However, these calculations may neglect the cost of power interruptions.</p>
<p>The lifetime cost difference is smaller for lower-voltage distribution networks, on the range of 12-28% higher than overhead lines of equivalent voltage.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-1"><a class="header" href="#introduction-1">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>In the modern world, noise pollution has emerged as a significant environmental threat, often overlooked but with far-reaching implications on public health, well-being, and societal cohesion. While the dangers of noise pollution are well-documented, its insidious nature makes it challenging to address effectively. Furthermore, in some cases, noise pollution has been deliberately exploited by fascist governments to polarize societies along religious lines, further exacerbating the negative consequences of this silent crisis.</p>
<h3 id="the-impact-of-noise-pollution-on-health"><a class="header" href="#the-impact-of-noise-pollution-on-health">The Impact of Noise Pollution on Health</a></h3>
<p>Noise pollution is defined as any unwanted or disturbing sound that affects the quality of life and health of humans and other living organisms. It is a pervasive problem in urban areas, where the cacophony of traffic, construction, and industrial activities creates an unrelenting assault on the senses. The effects of noise pollution on human health are manifold, ranging from mild annoyance to severe physical and psychological disorders.</p>
<p>One of the most common health impacts of noise pollution is hearing loss. Prolonged exposure to loud noise can cause irreversible damage to the delicate hair cells in the inner ear, leading to permanent hearing impairment. In addition to hearing loss, noise pollution has been linked to sleep disturbances, cardiovascular issues, and increased stress levels.</p>
<p>Chronic exposure to noise pollution can also lead to cognitive impairments, particularly in children. Studies have shown that children living in noisy environments tend to have lower reading comprehension, memory retention, and problem-solving abilities compared to their peers in quieter neighborhoods. This has significant implications for educational attainment and overall life outcomes.</p>
<h3 id="the-exploitation-of-religious-noise-pollution-by-fascist-governments"><a class="header" href="#the-exploitation-of-religious-noise-pollution-by-fascist-governments">The Exploitation of Religious Noise Pollution by Fascist Governments</a></h3>
<p>In some instances, noise pollution has been deliberately weaponized by <a href="https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/democracy/fascism.html">fascist governments to sow discord and polarize societies along religious lines</a>. This is particularly evident in countries where religious minorities are subjected to targeted noise pollution as a form of psychological warfare.</p>
<p>For example, in India, Hindu nationalist groups have been accused of using loudspeakers to blast religious songs and chants outside mosques during Muslim prayer times, creating a cacophony that makes it difficult for worshippers to concentrate. This deliberate noise pollution is a form of harassment designed to intimidate and marginalize religious minorities, fueling tensions and deepening societal divisions.</p>
<p>As the festival of Ram Navami approaches, concerns arise regarding the potential misuse of loudspeakers by political factions seeking to exploit this religious occasion for their own gain. Rather than promoting peaceful celebrations and <a href="https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/democracy/hinduism.html">fostering spiritual growth</a>, the excessive use of loudspeakers can lead to noise pollution, disrupting the lives of local residents and exacerbating tensions within communities. It is crucial for governments and religious organizations to prioritize the well-being of citizens and the environment, promoting responsible use of loudspeakers and ensuring that festivals remain a time for unity, harmony, and spiritual reflection. By doing so, we can work together to combat the negative effects of noise pollution and preserve the true essence of religious celebrations.</p>
<p>In light of the upcoming Ram Navami celebrations, it is imperative that we reconsider the role of loudspeakers in these festivities. Instead of allowing them to become a tool for political posturing and noise pollution, we should strive for a more introspective and spiritual approach to the occasion. By focusing on the actual values of Lord Ram and promoting personal growth and reflection, we can ensure that the true spirit of Ram Navami is preserved.</p>
<h3 id="peace-silence-and-prayer"><a class="header" href="#peace-silence-and-prayer">Peace, silence and prayer</a></h3>
<p>Throughout the Ramayana, Lord Ram consistently upholds principles of peace, compassion, and justice. He adheres to his duty as a prince and later as an exiled king with utmost integrity, despite facing numerous trials and tribulations. He exemplifies forgiveness, even towards those who wrong him, such as his stepmother Kaikeyi and the demon king Ravana. In the end, his victory over Ravana is not just a triumph of physical strength but also of righteousness and truth.</p>
<p>In Hindu philosophy, the concept of peace (shanti) is highly valued. It is believed that inner peace leads to harmony with the external world. Prayer, meditation, and religious rituals are often seen as means to attain this inner peace, enabling individuals to lead fulfilling and virtuous lives.</p>
<h2 id="noise-and-ram-navami"><a class="header" href="#noise-and-ram-navami">Noise and Ram Navami</a></h2>
<p>The celebration of Ram Navami is often accompanied by such <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/odisha/story/odisha-man-dies-from-heart-attack-due-to-loud-sound-during-saraswati-idol-immersion-2506684-2024-02-24">loud noise that people can even suffer heart attacks</a>.</p>
<p>We have shifted prayer and spirituality to noise pollution during Ram Navami celebrations, and it has become a political tool to garner voters through polarization and the promotion of Hindu supremacy.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion-1"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-1">Conclusion</a></h3>
<p>Noise pollution is a silent crisis that demands greater attention from policymakers, public health experts, and society at large. Its impact on human health and well-being is significant and far-reaching, affecting not only individuals but also entire communities and societies.</p>
<p>Moreover, the exploitation of religious noise pollution by fascist governments to polarize societies along religious lines is a particularly egregious form of this silent crisis. It is essential that we recognize the dangers of noise pollution and take concrete steps to mitigate its impact on our lives and the world around us. This includes implementing effective noise reduction strategies, raising public awareness about the dangers of noise pollution, and promoting interfaith dialogue and understanding to counter the divisive effects of religious noise pollution.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-story-of-prahlada-and-holika-teaches-us-that-good-will-always-triumph-over-evil"><a class="header" href="#the-story-of-prahlada-and-holika-teaches-us-that-good-will-always-triumph-over-evil">The story of Prahlada and Holika teaches us that good will always triumph over evil</a></h1>
<p>The story of Prahlada and Holika teaches us that good will always triumph over evil, and that devotion and faith can overcome even the most powerful adversaries. This is a lesson that we can apply to our modern-day struggles, especially in the political arena.</p>
<p>One of the most pressing issues facing our democracy today is the prevalence of dictatorship and the manipulation of the voting process. In many countries, including India, the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) has raised concerns about the accuracy and integrity of election results. The lack of transparency in the counting and tabulation of votes has led to widespread doubts about the legitimacy of election outcomes.</p>
<p>This is where we can draw inspiration from the story of Prahlada. Like Prahlada, who remained steadfast in his devotion to Vishnu despite the threats of his evil father, we must also remain steadfast in our commitment to democracy and the rule of law. We must not allow the forces of dictatorship and corruption to undermine our democratic institutions, and we must demand transparency and accountability in our electoral processes.</p>
<p>One way to achieve this is to ban the use of electronic voting machines and return to a paper-based system of voting. While EVMs were initially introduced to improve the speed and efficiency of vote counting, their use has been marred by allegations of tampering and fraud. By returning to a paper-based system, we can ensure that every vote is counted and that the results accurately reflect the will of the people.</p>
<p>In addition to banning EVMs, we must also work to end dictatorship and promote democratic values. This means standing up to authoritarian leaders who seek to consolidate power and silence dissent. It means supporting civil society organizations and independent media that hold our leaders accountable and promote transparency and accountability. And it means educating our citizens about the importance of voting and the role they play in shaping our democracy.</p>
<p><a href="https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/democracy/fascism.html">The fascist government’s unabated manipulation of legal systems, scapegoating, and discrimination have reached alarming levels.</a> It has weakened or abolished democratic institutions and relentlessly suppressed opposition, arresting anyone who dares to dissent. In these trying times, we must draw inspiration from the story of Prahlada, who remained steadfast and unmoved by the relentless efforts of Hiranyakashipu to destroy him. Prahlada’s unwavering faith and devotion serve as a beacon of hope, reminding us of the power of perseverance in the face of adversity. We must emulate Prahlada’s resilience and stand firm in our commitment to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. By working together and supporting each other, we can overcome the challenges posed by authoritarian regimes and create a society that values justice, equality, and freedom for all.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/Pp8iO">‘Billionaire Raj’ Is Pushing India Toward Autocracy</a></p>
<p>The super-rich have opened their wallets to Modi, and income inequality has soared over the past decade. With an election coming, ordinary voters need to ask, ‘What’s in it for us?’</p>
<p>As we celebrate Holi and the triumph of good over evil, let us remember the lessons of Prahlada and use them to guide our actions in the fight for democracy and justice. By standing up to dictatorship and demanding transparency and accountability in our electoral processes, we can ensure that our voices are heard and our votes are counted. Let us work together to create a brighter future for ourselves and for generations to come.</p>

<p>The diet of the earliest hominins was probably somewhat similar to the diet of modern chimpanzees: omnivorous, including large quantities of fruit, leaves, flowers, bark, insects and meat.</p>
<h2 id="eating-meat-drove-the-evolution-of-our-big-powerful-brain"><a class="header" href="#eating-meat-drove-the-evolution-of-our-big-powerful-brain">Eating meat drove the evolution of our big, powerful brain</a></h2>

<p>The modern human brain is two to three times larger than that of our closest relatives, chimpanzees. But to supply energy to such metabolically demanding tissue, a distinct trade-off in energy allocation had to evolve.</p>
<p>In 1992, researchers proposed that this gradual expansion of the ancestral brain was made possible by switching from a vegetative diet to a meat-rich, fat-rich diet. As meat became a dietary staple, the gut shortened, and the brain no longer needed to rely on fuel from muscle and fat stores in the body. A shorter gut requires a great deal less energy than the lengthy gut of herbivores. Drawing on the extra energy resources from a fatty diet, and a shorter gut, the brain could afford to grow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are several important brain nutrients that simply do not exist in plants or fungi</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creatine, carnosine, taurine, EPA and DHA omega-3 (the third kind can be found in plants), haem iron and vitamins B12 and D3 generally only occur naturally in foods derived from animal products, though they can be synthesised in the lab or extracted from non-animal sources such as algae, bacteria or lichen, and added to supplements.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the children who were given the soup containing meat each day seemed to have a significant edge. By the end of the study, they outperformed all the other children on a test for non-verbal reasoning. Along with the children who received soup with added oil, they also did the best on a test of arithmetic ability. Of course, more research is needed to verify if this effect is real, and if it would also apply to adults in developed countries, too. But it does raise intriguing questions about whether veganism could be holding some people back.</p>

<p>Which foods cause the most greenhouse gas emissions?</p>
<p>Animal-based foods, especially red meat, dairy, and farmed shrimp, are generally associated with the highest greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Meat production often requires extensive grasslands, which is often created by cutting down trees, releasing carbon dioxide stored in forests.</p>
<h2 id="high-meat-consumption-linked-to-obesity"><a class="header" href="#high-meat-consumption-linked-to-obesity">High Meat Consumption Linked to Obesity</a></h2>
<p>Several studies have found a positive correlation between high meat consumption and obesity. For example, a study published in the International Journal of Obesity found that individuals who consumed high amounts of meat had a 33% higher risk of central obesity compared to those who consumed less meat.</p>
<p><a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2009/wang-meat-consumption-obesity">Diets High in Meat Consumption Associated with Obesity</a></p>
<p>Moreover, a diet high in meat may also lack essential nutrients found in plant-based foods, such as fiber, vitamins, and minerals, which are essential for maintaining a healthy weight and preventing chronic diseases. A balanced diet should include a variety of foods from all food groups, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats, to ensure that all necessary nutrients are obtained.</p>
<h2 id="the-cultural-significance-of-meat-consumption"><a class="header" href="#the-cultural-significance-of-meat-consumption">The Cultural Significance of Meat Consumption</a></h2>
<p>Meat consumption is not just a biological necessity; it is also an essential part of many cultural practices. In many societies, meat is a symbol of wealth, power, and status. For instance, in many African cultures, meat is considered a delicacy and is served during special occasions and ceremonies. Similarly, in many Indigenous cultures, hunting and meat consumption are integral to their cultural identity and way of life.</p>
<p>Therefore, the cultural significance of meat consumption cannot be ignored. Attempts to impose vegetarianism or veganism on people who have deep-rooted cultural connections to meat consumption can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism. Instead, we should focus on promoting responsible meat consumption that takes into account the cultural practices and beliefs of different communities.</p>
<h2 id="animal-sacrifice-and-superstition"><a class="header" href="#animal-sacrifice-and-superstition">Animal Sacrifice and Superstition</a></h2>
<p>While meat consumption can offer numerous health benefits and has played a significant role in human evolution, it is crucial to distinguish between its use as a source of nutrition and its involvement in animal sacrifice and superstition.</p>
<p>The practice of animal sacrifice, however, raises concerns about animal welfare and can perpetuate a culture of violence and disregard for the sanctity of life.</p>
<p>Superstition, on the other hand, involves the belief in supernatural influences and the attribution of events to causes that have no logical explanation. When it comes to meat consumption, superstition can lead to misguided beliefs and practices that may pose a danger to both human and animal health.</p>
<p>In some underdeveloped communities, the belief in supernatural forces and the need to appease these entities can result in horrific acts of violence, including the sacrifice of human lives.</p>
<p>The persistence of misguided beliefs and practices, such as animal sacrifice, serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers that can arise from the intersection of superstition and human behavior. In some underdeveloped communities, the belief in supernatural forces and the need to appease these entities can result in horrific acts of violence, including the sacrifice of human lives.</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-personal-choice"><a class="header" href="#the-importance-of-personal-choice">The Importance of Personal Choice</a></h2>
<p>The decision to consume meat or abstain from it is a deeply personal one that should be based on individual preferences, beliefs, and cultural practices. Imposing vegetarianism or veganism on people based on religious grounds can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism that undermines the agency of individuals to make their own choices. Moreover, it can lead to a sense of alienation and exclusion among those who do not adhere to the prescribed dietary practices.</p>
<p>Religious indoctrination to quit meat can also lead to conflicts within families and communities, especially in cultures where meat consumption is an essential part of social and cultural practices. For instance, in many Hindu households, meat is served during special occasions and festivals, and abstaining from it can be seen as a rejection of cultural traditions and practices.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-2"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-2">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>The debate surrounding meat politics has become increasingly polarized, with advocates for vegetarianism and veganism on one side and those who support responsible meat consumption on the other. While it is essential to consider the environmental impact of meat production and consumption, it is equally important to recognize the historical, evolutionary, and health benefits of meat consumption.</p>

<p><strong>gullibility</strong></p>
<p>tendency to believe too readily and therefore to be easily deceived</p>
<p>Gullibility is a failure of social intelligence in which a person is easily tricked or manipulated into an ill-advised course of action. It is closely related to credulity, which is the tendency to believe unlikely propositions that are unsupported by evidence.</p>

<li>If the next time, people elect Modi, he will leave no stone unturned to destroy the economy. The impact of many times national debt created, rampant taxation, taking over all institutions and corrupting it, and disinformation will soon be seen in the next five years.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a democracy, the people's choice holds immense power. If the Indian electorate chooses to re-elect Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it is crucial to understand the potential economic implications of his leadership. With a track record of excessive borrowing, increased taxation, and the erosion of institutional integrity, the next five years could witness a severe economic downturn.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Debt can boost the economy for some time, everything can appear green for that time, but finally, you have to pay the debt.</li>
</ol>
<p>While short-term economic growth can be stimulated by borrowing, the long-term consequences of accumulating debt can be devastating. As the debt burden grows, the government's ability to invest in essential sectors like infrastructure, education, and healthcare diminishes. Eventually, the repayment of these debts will necessitate austerity measures, leading to reduced public spending and further economic contraction.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>As govt will have no money left for spending, it will rely on taxes as much as they can, taxing everything possible. Excessive taxation will cause dead weight loss, which means a decrease in trade, rise of prices, creating a vicious cycle for economic collapse.</li>
</ol>
<p>Faced with mounting debt and dwindling resources, the government may resort to excessive taxation to generate revenue. However, this strategy can backfire, leading to a decrease in trade, higher prices, and ultimately, an economic collapse. Dead weight loss, a term used in economics to describe the loss of economic efficiency, can result from such policies, as consumers and businesses adjust their behavior to avoid the increased tax burden.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Govt can also rely on printing more and more money for govt spending ultimately devaluing the currency.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another potential response to the government's financial woes is the printing of more money to fund public spending. While this may provide temporary relief, it can lead to inflation and the devaluation of the currency. As the value of the rupee decreases, imports become more expensive, and the purchasing power of the average citizen diminishes. This can further exacerbate the economic crisis.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>We already seen economic policies like demonetization and COVID mismanagement which made a disastrous impact on the economy.</li>
</ol>
<p>The economic policies implemented under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, such as demonetization and the mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic, have already had a detrimental impact on the Indian economy.</p>

<p>What will you choose: rampant exploitation by big corporates or social welfare? Confused voters of Odisha have chosen the former.</p>
<p>The governance of the Modi-led BJP and the Naveen-led BJD is markedly different. One focuses on big corporates and privatization, while the other leans towards social welfare to some extent. Although the BJD may have its flaws, politics under the First-Past-the-Post (FPTP) voting system is not about choosing between good and evil, but rather between lesser evils. By opting for a more evil government over a less evil one, Odisha has made a significant mistake.</p>
<p>Odisha, among the 9 poorest states in India, has seen significant progress in reducing poverty under Naveen Patnaik's leadership. According to the Niti Aayog's Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report, poverty in Odisha reduced by 48% in the past five years. In 2022-23, only 11.07% of the state's population was considered multidimensionally poor.</p>
<p>While data may be questioned due to the lack of high-quality data in India, some conclusions can still be drawn, albeit not entirely accurate.</p>
<p>It is evident that the Modi-led government has been reluctant to conduct surveys and provide authentic, elaborate, and data-driven insights from thorough research based questionnaires.  This could have exposed inefficiencies in governance and invited criticism, so it seems that the government is more content with no data rather than quality data. Additionally, research funding for surveys has been limited.</p>
<h2 id="more-disinformation-in-odisha"><a class="header" href="#more-disinformation-in-odisha">More disinformation in Odisha</a></h2>
<p>India has become number one in spreading disinformation.</p>
<p>For example, to win the election, a campaign filled with bigotry and hatred was directed towards Pandian. By portraying the Tamil Pandian as a secret Chief Minister of Odisha and <a href="https://42683ff2b1a2ac5ad2fef0ee01995d78.ipfs.4everland.link/ipfs/bafybeiestxq2cmm6smn3gbuud4rsjswnoarc6zgyew2mh2od66745ftg4a">mocking the Tamil way of life</a>.</p>
<p>The BJP is adept at hate politics, as evidenced by their targeting of a Tamil Pandian who has lived and worked in the state for 20 years and speaks fluent Odia. They promote the idea that loyalty to the state should be determined by blood, which is a divisive and discriminatory ideology.</p>
<p>Do you prefer a candidate like Pandian from an independent regional party, or do you support a system where the chief minister and all other ministers and bureaucrats are mere bootlickers, remote-controlled by Modi and Shah? These bootlickers elevate Modi to the status of a god, placing him even above Lord Jagannath.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may end up with a Chief Minister who is <a href="https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/democracy/hinduism.html">ideologically driven by the RSS</a>, lacking the technical expertise to tackle complex economic issues, create jobs, and provide quality education. Moreover, such a leader may not possess the sociological understanding required to foster religious harmony, leading to potential social unrest. In contrast, an educated Chief Minister is essential to navigate the intricacies of governance, make informed decisions, and ensure the overall development of the state.</p>

<p>Do you prefer the South model, exemplified by Pandian, which is widely regarded as one of the most successful models in India, or do you opt for the Gujarat capitalist model, which boasts high education dropout rates, malnourished children, and exorbitant electricity bills? The choice between these two distinct models presents a clear contrast in priorities and outcomes.</p>
<p>Although there have been instances of collaboration between the BJP and the BJD, including the passing of bills that some may deem undemocratic, the BJD has largely maintained a safe distance from the BJP. Despite their occasional cooperation, the BJD has strived to preserve its independence and differentiate itself from the BJP's ideology and policies.</p>
<p>The trend of independent anchors resigning from TV news channels is concerning, BJP led govt in odisha paves the way for heightened propaganda and hatred in Odia news media. It appears that Odia news channels are emulating the model of national TV news channels during Modi's era of full majority, where biased and divisive content thrived. This development undermines journalistic integrity and sets a dangerous precedent for media manipulation in the state of Odisha.</p>
<p>The government will continue to exploit WhatsApp and other social media platforms to disseminate disinformation, conceal its flaws, and manipulate public opinion through emotional appeals. This tactic enables them to shape public perception and maintain control over the narrative, often at the expense of transparency and factual information.</p>

<p>As the influence of religious groups continues to grow in our society, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the political landscape is shifting in a manner that reflects this. With the rise of religious politics, we are seeing the implementation of measures such as curfews and internet shutdowns in an attempt to maintain order and control. While these actions may seem necessary to some, the long-term consequences of such restrictions can be detrimental to both individuals and the economy as a whole.</p>
<p>Internet shutdowns, in particular, are a cause for concern. By cutting off access to the internet, essential communication channels, vital information sources, and online businesses are hindered. This not only affects the ability of citizens to stay connected and informed but also has a direct impact on the economy. Small businesses, freelancers, and entrepreneurs who rely on the internet to conduct their work can suffer significant financial losses during these shutdowns, leading to a potential decline in the economy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/28/in-2022-the-world-saw-187-internet-shutdowns-84-by-india-alone">In 2022, the world saw 187 internet shutdowns – 84 by India alone</a></p>
<p>Moreover, the normalization of curfews and internet shutdowns can lead to a further erosion of civil liberties and individual freedoms. As these measures become more commonplace, citizens may become desensitized to the infringement of their rights, ultimately allowing for more drastic and authoritarian policies to be enacted in the name of maintaining order.</p>

<p>Odisha, endowed with abundant mineral resources, faces the risk of rampant exploitation, which could endanger the livelihoods of tribal communities dependent on the forests. The state's mineral wealth has caught the attention of corporate giants like Adani, Ambani, and other conglomerates. While they may tout their activities as necessary for development, the reality is that the lives and ecosystems of tribal people are at stake. The propagation of pro-development propaganda through various media channels, including TV news, newspapers, and social media, serves to mask the potential detrimental impacts on the vulnerable communities and the environment.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-happen-to-the-welfare-schemes-of-naveen-led-govt"><a class="header" href="#what-will-happen-to-the-welfare-schemes-of-naveen-led-govt">What will happen to the welfare schemes of Naveen led Govt?</a></h2>
<p>What will happen to various welfare schemes like BSKY, Mamata Jojana, SHG group?</p>
<p>What will happen to public transport, Mo Bus, Lakhmi Bus?</p>
<p>Things seem to be now uncertain.</p>
<p>The fate of the 5T schools, known for their improved infrastructure under Naveen's leadership, is uncertain under a BJP government led by Modi. The quality of education in Odisha under the leadership of Naveen remains questionable. However, it is worth acknowledging that the school infrastructure has witnessed some positive changes and improvements during his tenure. Modi, who has positioned himself as a divine, non-biological entity, promotes pseudoscience over scientific facts, as evidenced by his party's efforts to remove the theory of evolution from the curriculum. This raises concerns about the BJP's commitment to educational standards and their potential disregard for evidence-based learning.</p>
<h2 id="lakshmi-bus-scheme"><a class="header" href="#lakshmi-bus-scheme">Lakshmi bus scheme</a></h2>
<p>The BJP government was never a fan of public transport, that benefits the middle-class and poor, instead their policies are to build car centric infrastructure. The Lakshmi bus scheme is now under uncertainty. BJP government may not expand it further instead, busy is shutting down the services. Lakshmi bus is already shut down in Malkangiri.</p>
<h2 id="the-manifesto"><a class="header" href="#the-manifesto">The Manifesto</a></h2>
<p>Naveen made a promise to provide 100 units of free electricity, a feat that the BJP government would find difficult to replicate. Instead, there is evidence of a coal scam by corporates, leading to an increase in electricity prices beyond affordability.</p>
<p>Roof-top solar installations, led by the Modi government, are also questionable. Although the Modi government has done some good work on solar infrastructure, this too can be challenged as they are attempting to create a corporate-based solar grid to keep solar power under the control of corporations, rather than allowing people to run rooftop solar systems.</p>

<h2 id="free-money-an-electoral-fraud"><a class="header" href="#free-money-an-electoral-fraud">Free money: An Electoral Fraud</a></h2>
<p>Distributing free money without addressing supply chain issues and controlling inflation and without taking account of state income is a form of electoral fraud, akin to vote buying.</p>
<h3 id="subhadra-yojana"><a class="header" href="#subhadra-yojana">Subhadra Yojana</a></h3>
<p>How will <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/odisha/bjd-mp-sulata-deo-calls-subhadra-yojana-an-election-gimmick-criticizes-limited-benefits-for-women/article68564892.ece">10,000 rupees per year help women</a> and the economy? With 10,000 rupees, one receives only 833 rupees per month. What can one do with 833 rupees? It can barely buy meals for two to three days. Furthermore, the excessive debts and printing of money will only further devalue the currency and decrease purchasing power. If the government provided rations with a fixed amount, we could ensure that the benefit would not fluctuate with changing prices. This promise of 833 rupees per month, without addressing supply chain issues and inflation, is nothing but an electoral gimmick and a fraudulent attempt to fool the people.</p>
<p>Additionally, the scheme has limited reach. With a female population of 2.25 crore in Odisha, the scheme only reaches 70 lakh women.</p>
<h2 id="free-money-and-hyperinflation"><a class="header" href="#free-money-and-hyperinflation">Free money and hyperinflation</a></h2>
<p>When a <a href="https://mru.org/courses/principles-economics-macroeconomics/zimbabwe-currency-inflation">government prints and distributes large amounts of free money</a> without addressing supply chain issues and inflation, it can lead to hyperinflation, where prices of goods and services increase rapidly. This occurs because the excess supply of money outpaces the supply of goods, causing each unit of currency to lose value. As prices rise, the purchasing power of individuals decreases, leading to increased debt as people borrow to maintain their standard of living. This cycle of printing more money to service the growing debt further exacerbates inflation, creating a vicious cycle that can ultimately lead to the destruction of an economy.</p>
<h2 id="the-bulldozer-government-destroying-local-businesses"><a class="header" href="#the-bulldozer-government-destroying-local-businesses">The Bulldozer Government: Destroying Local Businesses</a></h2>
<p>The BJP government has a track record of bulldozing small businesses, and their actions often leave local communities and entrepreneurs suffering. These road sides are often the lifeblood of local communities, providing a means for small business owners to support their families and offer convenient services to the public. What is the purpose of govt land? While it is true that road sides are typically government property, the purpose of such property is to serve the public. These entrepreneurs don't have the same opportunities and money  as large corporations to build supermarkets, and must instead make do with limited resources with roadside business. The destruction of the Bhadrak market, where countless shops have been bulldozed, is a prime example of the government's shortsighted and dictatorship approach. <a href="https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/road-planning-of-cities.html#city-traffic-sucks-they-should-widen-the-roads">Widening roads to accommodate cars</a> will never be enough, and the true loss is felt by those whose livelihoods are being destroyed in the name of "progress."</p>

<h2 id="role-of-opposition"><a class="header" href="#role-of-opposition">Role of Opposition</a></h2>
<p>This time, the BJP, as a single party, has not secured a full majority in the center. The opposition has gained strength and their role is to expose the government's lies and prevent the situation from worsening.</p>
<h2 id="suggestion-for-political-reform-in-bjd"><a class="header" href="#suggestion-for-political-reform-in-bjd">Suggestion for Political Reform in BJD</a></h2>
<p>Naveen Patnaik can no longer lead due to his old age. He is now 77 and suffers from various ailments. It's time for him to retire. But what will be the future of the BJD? Political parties have always depended on a single leader, and elections are fought based on that single leader's name. The defeat of the BJD was partly because the BJP highlighted that Naveen Patnaik is no longer able to lead, questioning how a Tamil from a different state could lead the BJD. Pandian is not Odia.</p>
<p>It's time for reform in the BJD. Leaders should be elected by party workers, and it's crucial to use <a href="https://electionscience.org/approval-voting-faqs/">Approval Voting</a> or Score Voting to select the leader, not the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) system. FPTP is a terrible voting method due to vote splitting; it is unlikely to yield the best leader or reflect the consensus of party workers and the people.</p>
<p>Additionally, decision-making needs to be more decentralized. The BJD can form evidence based <a href="https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacecfk7ruyr2cyk4px5o4op6tzdfnkwfzah3t5drrwxrftznfahhn3c?filename=Laloux%2C%20Frederic%20-%20Reinventing%20Organizations_%20A%20Guide%20to%20Creating%20Organizations%20Inspired%20by%20the%20Next%20Stage%20of%20Human%20Consciousness-Nelson%20Parker%20%282014%29.epub">teal organization to handle a self-managed system effectively</a> decreasing centralized decision-making.</p>
<p>This approach can also be applied to other political parties, such as Congress or other regional parties.</p>
<h2 id="fptp-the-most-problematic-voting-method"><a class="header" href="#fptp-the-most-problematic-voting-method">FPTP: The Most Problematic Voting Method</a></h2>
<p>FPTP, or the first-past-the-post voting method, is indeed considered one of the most problematic voting systems. The example provided illustrates this issue well. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) secured 37.4% of the vote share but did not win any seats, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 20 out of 21 seats with a 45.4% vote share. It's a completely unfair distribution of seats. One can also consider the opaque EVM voting system and its potential for manipulation.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="elon-on-twitter-censorship"><a class="header" href="#elon-on-twitter-censorship">Elon on twitter censorship</a></h1>
<p>According to <a href="https://thewire.in/government/x-twitter-election-commission-takedown-orders-disagrees">Elon Musk's X statement</a>, "We disagree with these actions and maintain that freedom of expression should extend to these posts and political speech in general." It seems that Elon Musk, as the new owner of Twitter, is advocating for more freedom of expression on the platform.</p>
<p>In an unexpected twist of fate, tech mogul Elon Musk has become the unlikely champion of free speech, vigorously defending the First Amendment rights of Twitter users across the globe. His unwavering dedication to ensuring that every voice is heard, no matter how unpopular or dissenting, has earned him widespread praise and admiration.</p>
<p>However, behind the scenes, a shocking truth has emerged: Elon disagrees with nothing, otherwise, he would have fought the legal battle in court. He is, in fact, another fascist, far-right clown billionaire attempting to curb freedom of speech. That was the sole reason for taking over Twitter.</p>
<p>"Ironically, Musk's commitment to free speech is so strong that he has filed a lawsuit against himself to prove his devotion to the cause," said an anonymous source within Musk's inner circle. "He truly believes that the best way to protect free speech is to take over the world's most influential social media platform and manipulate it to his own liking."</p>
<p>Doesn't our constitution provide freedom of speech as a fundamental right? Absolutely, but it seems that Musk's understanding of this principle is a bit skewed. As an easy win in courts, one might expect him to take a stand for the First Amendment. However, Musk will never do that. Instead, he prefers to wield his power and influence to shape the discourse to his own ends, all while cloaked in the guise of a champion of free speech.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Absolute power corrupts absolutely." In this case, it appears that Elon Musk's absolute power over Twitter has led him to become the very thing he claims to be fighting against: a threat to freedom of speech.</p>

<p>Palki Sharma presents three arguments on development.</p>
<h2 id="financial-inclusion"><a class="header" href="#financial-inclusion">Financial Inclusion</a></h2>
<p>According to her, paying through UPI is considered development. However, it's actually a dangerous move. It's about relinquishing control of your finances to the government, enabling them to seize your account anytime there's protest or dissent. Thousands of bank accounts have already been blocked by the government, including those of the Congress Party.</p>
<p>Cash is still very easy to use, but the government has undermined the cash system through measures such as demonetization, which has <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176518302143">adversely affected the livelihoods of millions</a></p>
<p>Can poor and middle-class people bear the burden of maintaining a minimum balance?</p>
<p><a href="factcheck/../image/minimum_balance.jpg">Banks collected over Rs21,00 Cr for breaching minimum balance norm</a></p>
<h2 id="internet-or-digital-penetration"><a class="header" href="#internet-or-digital-penetration">Internet or digital penetration</a></h2>
<p>While during Congress's tenure, there were more than 12 service providers, under the new Modi government, the number has dwindled to two or three. None of them offer optimal service; Airtel is somewhat better, but Jio is worse. The government seems to prioritize corporate profits and foster monopolies. As for digital penetration, the credit should be attributed to cheaper mobiles from China rather than Modi's India.</p>
<h2 id="airport-traffic"><a class="header" href="#airport-traffic">Airport Traffic</a></h2>
<p>Is airport traffic a good thing? In a country where 90% of the population belongs to the middle class, air travel is hardly accessible. Moreover, it's one of the biggest contributors to pollution, especially in the era of climate change. During summer, heat waves last for two months, with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius. What we truly need is investment in <a href="https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/road-planning-of-cities.html">public transport</a>, which is currently lacking. Instead, Modi's focus seems to be on building roads for a car-centric system, leading to pollution and traffic congestion that harm our ecosystem.</p>

<p>Tavleen Singh's article argues against what she perceives as Rahul Gandhi's inclination towards taxing the rich and redistributing wealth, advocating instead for policies that encourage wealth creation. However, her arguments overlook the detrimental effects of monopolies on markets and society. Here's a critique of her points:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Misrepresentation of Wealth Creation</strong>: While entrepreneurship and innovation are indeed drivers of economic growth, she overlooks how monopolies distort this process. Monopolies hinder competition and innovation by restricting entry into the market, stifling potential wealth creation from smaller players.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neglect of Monopoly Power</strong>: Singh fails to acknowledge the negative implications of monopoly power. Take for example pharmaceutical patents. By granting exclusive rights to produce and sell certain drugs, monopolies like GlaxoSmithKline can inflate prices significantly above production costs. This artificially high pricing limits access to essential medicines, leading to adverse health outcomes for those unable to afford them. Under the Congress government, we had about 12 internet service providers, but now we have just two or three.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7aadb3d7-4a03-44ba-a01e-8ddd8bce29ed">The mystery of the Adani coal imports that quietly doubled in value</a></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>Ignoring Economic Inequality</strong>: Singh's focus on preserving wealth creation without addressing the widening wealth gap overlooks a critical aspect of economic prosperity. Monopolies exacerbate inequality by concentrating wealth and power in the hands of a few, rather than fostering broad-based economic growth that benefits society as a whole.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monopolies provide taxes</strong>:Singh's argument that Adani and Ambani bring in more taxes is also incorrect. Decentralized systems without monopolies tend to collect more taxes than monopolies. Monopolies discourage entrepreneurship, and unchecked monopolistic practices also pose significant threats to economic freedom and prosperity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of Regulatory Consideration</strong>: Singh's argument against taxation and wealth redistribution overlooks the role of government regulation in curbing monopolistic behaviors. Effective regulation can promote competition, innovation, and equitable wealth distribution, thereby fostering a more dynamic and inclusive economy. Effective regulation also decreases negative externalities, especially in times of rampant pollution that impacts our health and leads to climate catastrophe.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, while Singh advocates for policies that promote wealth creation, her arguments fail to address the detrimental effects of monopolies on market competition, economic inequality, and societal welfare. A more nuanced approach that acknowledges the need for both entrepreneurship and effective regulation is essential for fostering sustainable and inclusive economic growth.</p>
<p>Wealth creation requires better wealth distribution and a free market without monopolies, rather than handing over everything to a few companies. The current government is running on rampant loans rather than focusing on wealth creation. The Congress government (Or the past UPA coalition government) has been better at achieving this than the current government. An economist as a Prime Minister is far better than an uneducated Prime Minister.</p>

<p><a href="factcheck/../image/modi_economics.jpeg">Paper</a></p>
<p>JUST BEFORE sitting down to write this piece, I spotted Rahul Gandhi's latest campaign video on social media. The video began with a poster of Gautam Adani's face on which the word 'BAN' was written. After this Rahul appeared and declared in an angry voice that he promised to give farmers, workers, and the poor as much money as 'Modi has given Adani'. This is only one of many campaign videos in which the inheritor of the Nehru-Gandhi legacy speaks of how when a Congress government comes to power, it will take money from the rich and distribute it to the poor.
It is time to remind the man who seeks to unseat Modi in this general election that it is not his personal wealth that he is threatening to hand out. It is taxpayers' money. It is not just the money of men like Adani and Ambani, but money given in taxes by all of us who pay taxes. What I find disturbing about Rahul's rants against rich Indians is his unconcealed contempt for those who create wealth. The private sector has survived and thrived despite socialist policies like the license raj, de- spite debilitating taxation. It deserves to be respected and not disdained. The wealth that is owned by men like Adani has not been 'given' to them by Modi or any other politician. It is wealth that they have created for the country, some of which is already being paid to the govern- ment in taxes. Why is this so hard for Rahul Gandhi to understand?</p>
<p>The Congress Party has repeatedly in- dicated that if it comes to power it has plans to introduce crippling new taxes on rich people. Sam Pitroda, famous for dam- aging the Congress Party's 'secularism' in the last general election, damaged its economic philosophy last week by announcing that it was time to bring back an inheritance tax. Congress spokesmen quickly distanced the party from Pitroda's statement, but redistribution of wealth Robin Hood style is something that Rahul Gandhi has talked about often since the campaign for this election began.
It is time for him to be reminded of what India looked like when taxes on the rich were so insane in his Granny's time that businessmen were ordered to pay 97% of their earnings as tax. The result was that not only was the private sector nearly de- stroyed but government itself had no money to distribute to the poor. It was a general redistribution of poverty that re- sulted. India has taken decades to recover and to prosper enough for a middle class to emerge and for a hesitant celebration of prosperity to begin. In the past ten years it is to Modi's credit that he has continued with economic policies that encourage the creation of wealth. In the opinion of those who would like to see the Indian economy really soar, he has not done enough to end socialism. He needs to do much more to totally rid us of an economic ideology that kept India mired in poverty.</p>
<p>Robin Hood Rahul also announced last week that he was so committed to order- ing a caste census that he has made it his life's mission. There can be compromises in politics, he said, but no compromises when you make something your life': mission. He has clarified more than once that the purpose of this census is to en able the redistribution of wealth. So castes that fall into the poorest categor will be the first to benefit. This is revers casteism at a time when the divisions caste in urban India have blurred. In vilages higher caste bigots may choose n to eat at the same table as those they com sider lower than them, but this is not po sible in a city restaurant.</p>

<p>Monopoly. It's not just a game. In this video we'll talk about how a firm uses market power to maximize profit. We'll begin with a controversial example.</p>
<p>This is the AIDS virus. Worldwide, it has killed more than 36 million people. In the United States, however, AIDS is no longer the death sentence that it once was. Beginning in the mid-1990s, death rates from AIDS began to fall dramatically with the introduction of new drugs such as Combivir. These new drugs are great, but they're expensive, and they're expensive not because it costs a lot to manufacture these drugs. The per-pill costs of production are actually quite low. Instead, these drugs are expensive because they're the subject matter of this chapter -- Monopoly.</p>
<p>GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, owns the patent on Combivir and that means that it has the right to exclude competitors. Only GSK can legally sell Combivir. The patent gives GSK a monopoly, or more generally we say it gives them market power. Market power is the power to raise price above marginal cost without fear that other firms will enter the market. Now how do we know the price is above marginal cost? Here's a simple test -- in the United States, Combivir costs around $12 to $13 per pill. India, however, does not recognize the patent on Combivir. So in India, there are many producers of Combivir who sell in a competitive market. As we know, in a competitive market, price will fall to marginal cost and in India the price of Combivir is about 50 cents per pill. Thus, in the United States, the price of Combivir is about 25 times higher than the marginal cost.</p>
<p>Let's say a few words about the sources of market power. The basic idea is that a firm has market power when it's selling a unique good and there are barriers to entry, forces which prevent competitors from entering the market. Barriers to entry could include patents, as we've already discussed. There may also be other government regulations creating barriers to entry, such as exclusive licenses. Economies of scale can mean that a single big firm can sell at lower cost than any of many small firms, making it difficult to establish a competitive market even with free entry. Exclusive access to an important input.</p>
<p>Diamonds, for example, are found in only a few places in the world. If you control a number of these diamond mines, you can monopolize the market for diamonds, where you will have market power in the market for diamonds. Technological innovations can give a firm temporary market power. A firm with knowledge or abilities that other firms don't yet have will have some market power, for example. Now we'll say a little bit more about these later. What we want to do now is to focus on how a firm with market power chooses to set its price. What is the profit maximizing price?</p>

<h2 id="print-media-funding-and-authenticity"><a class="header" href="#print-media-funding-and-authenticity">Print Media: Funding and Authenticity</a></h2>
<p>Print media in India, such as newspapers and magazines, rely primarily on reader subscriptions for funding. This means that the news provided by print media is mostly funded by users rather than corporations or advertisers. As a result, print media tends to focus on delivering authentic news that matters to the people, as they are directly accountable to their readers.</p>
<p>In recent years, print media has played a significant role in reporting news that mainstream TV media has largely ignored. For example, print media provided detailed news coverage of the electoral bonds scam, which involved the alleged misuse of funds by political parties. Similarly, print media reported extensively on the "BJP washing machine" scandal, highlighting how 25 opposition leaders facing corruption charges crossed over to the BJP, with 23 of them getting a reprieve.</p>
<p>Do check out which print media is delivering biased news, along with its owner, funding, and advertisements. You can quickly unsubscribe from biased print media and shift to another.</p>
<h2 id="mainstream-tv-media-funding-and-influence"><a class="header" href="#mainstream-tv-media-funding-and-influence">Mainstream TV Media: Funding and Influence</a></h2>
<p>Mainstream TV media in India, on the other hand, is funded mostly by advertisers and corporations. This has raised concerns about the influence of these entities on the news reporting process. Many argue that mainstream TV media tends to prioritize sensationalism and entertainment over providing in-depth, authentic news coverage.</p>
<p>Moreover, mainstream TV media comes with minimal TV package options, and users cannot unsubscribe news channels to save a substantial amount of money. This has led to a situation where people are forced to consume news from TV channels that may not provide authentic and unbiased information.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-we-tackle-mainstream-media"><a class="header" href="#how-can-we-tackle-mainstream-media">How can we tackle mainstream media?</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/law-today/story/supreme-court-on-pleas-regulate-tv-news-channels-media-tribunal-2418224-2023-08-08">Supreme Court stated</a>, "Don't watch if you don't like: Supreme Court on pleas to regulate TV news channels." However, the government is forcing us to pay for these channels through the minimum TV package. To address this issue, TV news channels should be excluded from the minimum package, allowing users to choose which channels they pay for. Why should we pay for propaganda channels? A similar Public Interest Litigation (PIL) should be submitted before the court to advocate for this change.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-3"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-3">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>While a statistical analysis of news coverage in both print and TV media would provide more concrete evidence, the anecdotal evidence presented in this article suggests that print media may indeed be a better source for authentic news in India. As citizens, it is essential to support and encourage the growth of independent, authentic news sources to ensure a well-informed and engaged society.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-identify-biased-media-and-make-informed-choices"><a class="header" href="#how-to-identify-biased-media-and-make-informed-choices">How to Identify Biased Media and Make Informed Choices</a></h2>
<p>In an era where information inundates us from all directions, discerning truth from bias has become a crucial skill. Print media, with its longstanding tradition of journalism, remains a significant source of news for many. However, not all publications adhere to unbiased reporting. Recognizing biased print media, understanding its ownership, funding sources, and advertisements can empower readers to make informed choices about where they get their news.</p>
<h3 id="identifying-bias"><a class="header" href="#identifying-bias">Identifying Bias</a></h3>
<p>Recognizing biased reporting requires a critical eye and an understanding of journalistic standards. Biased reporting often manifests in several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Selective Reporting</strong>: Biased media may cherry-pick facts or only present one side of a story while ignoring alternative perspectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Loaded Language</strong>: Pay attention to the language used in headlines and articles. Biased publications often employ emotionally charged language to sway readers' opinions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Omission of Context</strong>: Context is crucial in understanding news stories. Biased media may omit relevant information that contradicts their narrative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Opinion Disguised as Fact</strong>: Be wary of opinion pieces masquerading as news. While opinion pieces have their place, they should be clearly labeled as such.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="investigating-ownership-and-funding"><a class="header" href="#investigating-ownership-and-funding">Investigating Ownership and Funding</a></h3>
<p>Understanding the ownership and funding behind a publication can provide valuable insights into potential biases. Here's what to look for:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Owner Background</strong>: Research the individuals or entities that own the publication. Are they affiliated with any political parties, advocacy groups, or corporations that could influence editorial decisions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Corporate Ownership</strong>: Many media outlets are part of larger conglomerates with diverse business interests. Consider how these interests might influence the publication's reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Funding Sources</strong>: Examine where the publication's revenue comes from. Are they heavily reliant on advertising from specific industries or interest groups? Such dependencies can influence editorial content.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="analyzing-advertisements"><a class="header" href="#analyzing-advertisements">Analyzing Advertisements</a></h3>
<p>Advertisements can offer clues about a publication's target audience and potential biases:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Advertiser Profiles</strong>: Take note of the types of products or services advertised in the publication. Are there recurring themes or industries represented? This can shed light on the publication's target demographic and potential biases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sponsored Content</strong>: Be cautious of sponsored articles that may blur the lines between editorial content and advertising. While labeled as advertisements, they can still influence readers' perceptions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="making-informed-choices"><a class="header" href="#making-informed-choices">Making Informed Choices</a></h3>
<p>Armed with this knowledge, readers can make informed decisions about which print media to support:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Diversify Your Sources</strong>: Consume news from a variety of sources with differing perspectives. This helps mitigate the risk of echo chambers and provides a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fact-Check</strong>: Verify information from multiple reputable sources before accepting it as truth. Fact-checking organizations can help separate fact from fiction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be Skeptical</strong>: Approach news consumption with a healthy dose of skepticism. Question narratives presented by media outlets and seek out evidence to support claims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hold Media Accountable</strong>: Provide feedback to publications when you identify biased reporting or misinformation. Holding media accountable encourages journalistic integrity and transparency.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="introduction-2"><a class="header" href="#introduction-2">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The narrative that money is the defining factor in winning an election is deeply ingrained in our society. In a country where <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/elections/lok-sabha-2019/story/new-lok-sabha-has-475-crorepati-mps-adr-1535330-2019-05-26">88% of MPs are crorepatis</a>, it's hard to imagine politics without money. However, this belief often overlooks the critical role of authentic communication, community engagement, and vision in connecting with voters and winning their support. As independent candidates or political newcomers, it's crucial to understand how these factors can help you overcome the challenges of vote buying and the first-past-the-post (FPTP) system.</p>
<h2 id="the-myth-of-money-in-elections"><a class="header" href="#the-myth-of-money-in-elections">The Myth of Money in Elections</a></h2>
<p>While it's true that money plays a role in elections, it is not the sole determining factor. In fact, numerous examples of candidates with limited financial resources but strong grassroots support and compelling messages have proven that money is not a necessary factor to win an election.</p>
<h2 id="money-for-bribing-voters"><a class="header" href="#money-for-bribing-voters">Money for Bribing Voters</a></h2>
<p>In a constituency with 7 to 14 lakh voters, it's not even practical for a crorepati to bribe everyone. If they pay ₹500 per voter, it would cost about ₹70 crore. Moreover, most voters are not morally corrupt and will not vote for a candidate just for money. Additionally, voting is a secret affair; you might take a bribe from someone but still vote for another candidate if they have convinced you enough.</p>
<h2 id="money-for-marketing"><a class="header" href="#money-for-marketing">Money for Marketing</a></h2>
<p>Crorepatis invest heavily in marketing to build their narrative, for example, the sold-out corporate mainstream media campaigns promoting the central government 24/7. However, candidates does not need to spend crores on marketing. Loudspeakers and social media are the cheapest forms of communication to reach a large number of people, provided you are communicating authentically with techniques like deep canvassing and being more creative with your campaign. It's not the money, but the time you are willing to give, that is important.</p>
<h2 id="the-power-of-authentic-communication"><a class="header" href="#the-power-of-authentic-communication">The Power of Authentic Communication</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/how-to-tackle-disinformation.html">Authentic communication</a> is the cornerstone of any successful political campaign. It involves being genuine, transparent, and relatable to voters. By establishing trust and demonstrating a deep understanding of the issues that matter most to the community, candidates can connect with voters on a personal level. This connection is often more powerful than any amount of money spent on advertising or campaign materials.</p>
<h2 id="community-engagement-and-networking"><a class="header" href="#community-engagement-and-networking">Community Engagement and Networking</a></h2>
<p>Engaging with the community is another critical aspect of a winning election campaign. This involves attending local events, volunteering, and building relationships with local organizations, businesses, and residents. By actively participating in the community, candidates can demonstrate their commitment to the area and establish a strong network of supporters who can help spread their message.</p>
<h2 id="vision-and-a-practical-manifesto-to-deliver"><a class="header" href="#vision-and-a-practical-manifesto-to-deliver">Vision and a Practical Manifesto to Deliver</a></h2>
<p>A compelling vision for the future is another essential element of a successful election campaign. This vision should outline the candidate's goals and priorities for the community, demonstrating their understanding of the issues at hand and their commitment to finding practical solutions. A well-crafted manifesto can help candidates differentiate themselves from their opponents and provide voters with a clear understanding of what they can expect if the candidate is elected.</p>
<p>To create a <a href="https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/what-will-a-boycott-of-the-national-currency-give-us.html#manifesto">practical manifesto</a>, candidates should conduct thorough research on the issues facing their community and consult with local experts and stakeholders to develop feasible solutions. By presenting a realistic plan of action, candidates can demonstrate their competence and commitment to making a positive impact on the lives of their constituents.</p>
<p>Moreover, it's crucial for candidates to communicate their vision and manifesto effectively. This can be achieved through various channels, such as public forums, social media, and one-on-one conversations with voters. By consistently sharing their vision and manifesto, candidates can reinforce their message and inspire voters to support their campaign.</p>
<p>In summary, a compelling vision and a practical manifesto to deliver are essential components of a successful election campaign. By focusing on these factors, candidates can demonstrate their commitment to the community, differentiate themselves from their opponents, and inspire voters to support their campaign.</p>

<p>Instead of aiming straight for high-stakes elections such as those for Members of Parliament (MP), consider beginning your journey at the grassroots level. Running for local positions such as sarpanch or municipality councilor can provide invaluable experience and insights into the electoral process. These initial roles allow you to understand the dynamics of your community, develop a rapport with voters, and address local issues directly. By tackling these smaller-scale elections first, you build a solid foundation and gain the necessary skills to manage larger campaigns in the future.</p>
<p>Moreover, beginning with local elections helps you create a track record of public service and achievements. As a sarpanch or municipality councilor, you have the opportunity to implement projects and initiatives that directly impact your community, showcasing your capability to bring about positive change. These accomplishments become part of your political resume, which can be leveraged when you decide to run for higher offices such as Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) or MP. Each step up the political ladder allows you to expand your network, increase your visibility, and refine your strategies based on practical experience.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-the-fptp-system-and-vote-splitting"><a class="header" href="#understanding-the-fptp-system-and-vote-splitting">Understanding the FPTP System and Vote Splitting</a></h2>
<p>To maximize their chances of winning, independent candidates must also understand the <a href="https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/the-lok-sabha-election-is-about-regional-parties-vs-one-party-dictatorship.html#who-is-evil-whether-its-the-people-or-the-voting-method">first-past-the-post (FPTP) system</a> and the potential impact of vote splitting. In FPTP, the candidate with the most votes wins, even if they do not secure a majority. This can lead to vote splitting, where multiple candidates from the same party or ideology divide the vote, allowing a less popular candidate to win.</p>
<p>To overcome this challenge, independent candidates should focus on building a diverse coalition of supporters, reaching out to voters who may not typically vote for their party or ideology. By appealing to a wider range of voters, candidates can increase their chances of securing the most votes and winning the election.</p>
<h2 id="dao-to-run-your-political-organizations"><a class="header" href="#dao-to-run-your-political-organizations">DAO to Run Your Political Organizations</a></h2>
<p>Though it may be technically challenging to build, it is now possible to create a <a href="https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/shivarthu/Shivarthu.html">Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)</a> that manages and distributes funds based on the work done for the party through smart contracts. DAOs leverage blockchain technology to automate and democratize decision-making processes, ensuring transparency and accountability in the allocation of resources. This innovative approach can significantly disrupt the traditional political landscape by reducing the dependency on centralized authority and allowing for more equitable distribution of resources based on merit and contribution.</p>
<p>With a DAO, financial transactions and reward distributions are executed automatically through smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. This ensures that party members and volunteers are compensated fairly and transparently for their efforts, fostering a sense of trust and collaboration within the organization. By eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the potential for corruption, a DAO can enhance the efficiency and integrity of political operations.</p>
<p>Moreover, a DAO can help create a community-controlled organization that is truly aligned with the community's goals. Traditional political organizations often struggle with maintaining alignment between the leadership's actions and the community's needs and desires. However, with a DAO, decision-making power is distributed among the community members, allowing for more direct and democratic involvement in shaping the organization's direction and policies. This can lead to a more engaged and motivated supporter base, as individuals feel a greater sense of ownership and influence over the organization's activities.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-4"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-4">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>In conclusion, while money can certainly help a candidate's chances of winning an election, it is not the sole determining factor. Authentic communication, community engagement, and a compelling vision for the future can help independent candidates overcome the challenges of vote buying and the FPTP system. By focusing on these factors, candidates can build a strong foundation of support and increase their chances of winning the election.</p>

<h2 id="can-we-attribute-indias-struggles-solely-to-foreign-influence"><a class="header" href="#can-we-attribute-indias-struggles-solely-to-foreign-influence">Can we attribute India's struggles solely to foreign influence?</a></h2>
<p>Renowned Justice Katju certainly believes so, directing blame towards external forces for the country's enduring poverty and challenges. While it may be tempting to seek simplistic explanations for complex issues, the reality is often more nuanced.</p>
<p>It is true that foreign companies, particularly large tech corporations, wield significant power over developing nations like India through their control of patents, intellectual property rights, and closed-source technology. Giants like Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and OpenAI dominate the digital landscape, influencing everything from economic decisions to the information we consume. Their influence extends to shaping our beliefs and values, often without us even realizing it. This concentration of power is indeed concerning and warrants scrutiny. Big tech companies facilitate the transfer of wealth from the general populace to a selected few, exacerbating the already severe income inequality.</p>
<p>Justice Katju's argument about polarization as a tool used by foreigners to destabilize developing countries also holds some merit. India, for instance, has become a hotbed of disinformation, with political parties, especially those in power, leveraging IT cells to disseminate misleading information through channels like WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. Governments often initiate disinformation campaigns, but it is the big tech companies that serve as their enablers and amplifiers. Through inadequate content moderation, the monetization of disinformation, and prioritizing engagement above all else, these tech giants allow misinformation to spread unchecked, akin to a wildfire raging out of control. However, it is essential to recognize that the responsibility for these actions lies primarily with our own government, judiciary and citizens. We must acknowledge that governments and citizens worldwide are equally susceptible to the manipulative tactics of big tech companies. <strong>The struggle to curb their excessive power is a global one, and foreign citizens are just as much at the mercy of these corporations as we are</strong>.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that open-source technology, which offers an alternative to the dominance of big tech, has been championed by foreigners as well. While their efforts have not yet led to widespread success, it demonstrates that not all foreign influence is detrimental. Additionally, foreign journalists have played a crucial role in safeguarding our democracy when our mainstream media has often fallen short due to corporate influences.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while foreign influence may contribute to India's challenges, it is not the sole cause. The complex interplay of global powers, corporate interests, and domestic factors all shape the country's trajectory. Blaming foreigners alone oversimplifies the issue and distracts from the need for collective action to address the root causes of India's struggles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any government that achieves an absolute majority from a single party is likely to turn authoritarian. This is how power dynamics operate, with excessive centralization of power. In contrast, coalition governments and federal systems are seen as essential for maintaining a balanced, inclusive, and democratic society, particularly in diverse societies.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="why-dont-educated-indians-enter-politics"><a class="header" href="#why-dont-educated-indians-enter-politics">Why Don't Educated Indians Enter Politics?</a></h2>
<p>In India, a peculiar trend persists: highly educated individuals often shun politics. Instead, parents overwhelmingly push their children towards becoming IAS officers. But why?</p>
<h3 id="the-allure-of-entrance-exams"><a class="header" href="#the-allure-of-entrance-exams">The Allure of Entrance Exams</a></h3>
<p>Becoming an IAS officer involves passing one of the most grueling entrance exams in the country. This exam, with its bullshit rote learning and formulaic testing, offers immense satisfaction to those who clear it, knowing they have succeeded where 99.9% have failed. The competitive nature of the exam, with only 0.1% of candidates passing, offers a sense of accomplishment that is unmatched by the relatively straightforward process of entering politics. In elections for Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) or Members of Parliament (MPs), there are typically only 5–8 candidates on the ballot, which lacks the intense competition seen in the IAS exam. Who will compete with a handful of candidates on the ballot? We will compete in terms of millions. In politics, the satisfaction of winning against millions isn't present, reducing the allure. Moreover, while the flaws of the <a href="https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/the-lok-sabha-election-is-about-regional-parties-vs-one-party-dictatorship.html#who-is-evil-whether-its-the-people-or-the-voting-method">First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) voting system are well-known by experts</a>, few seem to focus on improving it.</p>
<h3 id="job-security"><a class="header" href="#job-security">Job Security</a></h3>
<p>Indians have a deep-seated obsession with job security, favoring government jobs that promise permanence. The IAS offers such security; once you pass the entrance exam, your future is secure. However, the path to becoming an IAS officer involves taking a much bigger risk than entering politics, with a daunting 99.9% failure rate. Despite these odds, many prefer this route, driven by the belief that once the entrance is cracked, life is set. In stark contrast, political positions are inherently risky, with terms lasting only a few years. Even though the salary of MPs, MLAs, or Sarpanchs is less than that of IAS officers, being a politician allows one to make significant contributions that can last for ages. Ironically, politicians have the power to set their own salaries through consensus of people, yet this doesn’t seem to attract educated individuals.</p>
<h3 id="the-bandwagon-effect"><a class="header" href="#the-bandwagon-effect">The Bandwagon Effect</a></h3>
<p>The bandwagon effect, where people follow trends simply because others are doing so, plays a significant role. If everyone is striving to become an IAS officer, individuals feel compelled to join the rat race, avoiding the less-trodden path of politics.</p>
<h3 id="prestige"><a class="header" href="#prestige">Prestige</a></h3>
<p>The IAS is viewed as a prestigious position, largely due to the bandwagon effect. On the other hand, politics comes with daily criticism and scrutiny. Despite the fact that IAS officers are often controlled by politicians who can transfer them at will if they don't listen to them and can't survive without corruption.</p>

<p><a href="https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/philosophy/bread_and_circus.html">Bread and Circus in the Digital Age: A Modern-Day Distraction from Reality</a></p>
<p>The recent victory parade for India's T20 World Cup win saw over 300,000 Indian youth in attendance, celebrating the triumph of their cricket team. However, this enthusiasm and unity are often lacking when it comes to addressing the country's pressing issues. The term "bread and circuses" comes to mind, as the Indian youth seem more interested in entertainment and distractions than engaging with the problems that affect their future.</p>
<p><img src="observation/./bread_circus/circus.jpg" alt="Gathering T20 Cup" /></p>
<h2 id="draconian-amendments-to-criminal-laws"><a class="header" href="#draconian-amendments-to-criminal-laws">Draconian Amendments to Criminal Laws</a></h2>
<p>One concerning development is the lack of protest against the recent amendments to India's criminal laws. These changes have the potential to turn India into a police state, with far-reaching implications for its citizens.</p>
<h3 id="extended-police-custody"><a class="header" href="#extended-police-custody">Extended Police Custody</a></h3>
<p>The new criminal law allows the police to seek direct custody of an accused for up to 60 days, a significant increase from the previous limit of 15 days. This change makes it even more difficult for accused individuals to obtain bail, as courts are typically reluctant to grant bail during police custody. With India's overcrowded jails already housing 75% under-trials, the "bail, not jail" principle emphasized by the Supreme Court is under threat.</p>
<h3 id="sedition-and-free-speech"><a class="header" href="#sedition-and-free-speech">Sedition and Free Speech</a></h3>
<p>While the word "sedition" has been absent from the new criminal law, experts argue that a more draconian version has been introduced through the back door. The criminalization of vague actions, such as "endangering sovereignty or unity and integrity of India," carries harsh punishments of up to life imprisonment. This raises concerns about free speech and the potential misuse of power by authorities.</p>
<h3 id="three-important-cases-pending-on-supreme-court"><a class="header" href="#three-important-cases-pending-on-supreme-court">Three important cases pending on supreme court</a></h3>
<h4 id="contitutional-validity-of-pmla"><a class="header" href="#contitutional-validity-of-pmla">Contitutional Validity of PMLA</a></h4>
<p>Firstly, the constitutional validity of the PMLA is being challenged in the Supreme Court. The law has been criticized for being excessively harsh and disproportionate in its application, with many opposition politicians being targeted under it. The Supreme Court must examine the law's provisions and decide if they are constitutional or not. This case is of utmost importance, as the misuse of the PMLA and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has been a contentious issue in Indian politics.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-a-money-bill"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-money-bill">What is a Money Bill?</a></h4>
<p>Secondly, the status of the Money Bill is pending before the Supreme Court. The government has been accused of using the Money Bill route to pass unconstitutional laws without the scrutiny of the Rajya Sabha. The apex court must clarify the definition of a Money Bill and ensure that it is not misused by the government. This case is crucial for the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches of the government.</p>
<h4 id="ritu-chhabria-case"><a class="header" href="#ritu-chhabria-case">Ritu Chhabria Case</a></h4>
<p>In the Ritu Chhabria case, as per the law, an accused person is entitled to default bail if the charge sheet filed by the state is incomplete and requires further investigation under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The time period for an investigative agency to complete an investigation and file a charge sheet ranges from 60 to 90 days, depending on the type of crime. If the agency fails to complete the investigation within the stipulated time, the accused is entitled to default bail or automatic bail.</p>
<p>However, this is not happening. In order to defeat the right to default bail, investigative agencies these days file charge sheets despite not completing the investigation. This is done solely to keep the accused incarcerated for a longer period. As a result, the accused remains incarcerated for a long time, which is a clear violation of their rights and the principles of justice and fairness.</p>

<h2 id="nta-exam-scam"><a class="header" href="#nta-exam-scam">NTA exam scam</a></h2>
<p>The lack of public outrage and mass gatherings, similar to the victory parade celebrations, in response to the NTA scam is concerning. The government's decision to proceed with the counseling process, despite the ongoing controversy, further highlights the disconnect between the authorities and the students' plight.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/21/millions-of-students-at-risk-indias-elite-exams-hit-by-corruption-scam">Millions of students at risk: India’s elite exams hit by corruption ‘scam’</a></p>
<h2 id="apathy-towards-protesting-athletes"><a class="header" href="#apathy-towards-protesting-athletes">Apathy Towards Protesting Athletes</a></h2>
<p>The Indian youth's enthusiasm for cricket and its players is undeniable, but where is this support when other athletes stand up for important causes? In May 2023, Olympic medal winner Vinesh Phogat and fellow wrestlers protested against the IOA's top official, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who was accused of sexual harassment and abuse.  Despite the presence of celebrated Olympic medallists, the protest was largely ignored by the cricket fraternity, with hardly any cricketers voicing their support. The absence of mass gatherings and a public outcry, similar to the victory parade for T20 Cup that attracted hundreds of thousands, highlights a selective interest in issues that demand attention and action.</p>
<p><img src="observation/./bread_circus/wrestlers.jpeg" alt="Wrestlers Protest" /></p>
<h2 id="silence-on-evm-manipulation"><a class="header" href="#silence-on-evm-manipulation">Silence on EVM Manipulation</a></h2>
<p>The manipulation of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in India has become increasingly apparent, with widespread mismatches between EVM votes during polling and counting. This raises serious concerns about the integrity of the voting process and democracy itself. However, there has been little to no outcry or gathering of the youth to demand transparency and accountability.</p>
<h2 id="ignoring-the-manipur-crisis"><a class="header" href="#ignoring-the-manipur-crisis">Ignoring the Manipur Crisis</a></h2>
<p>The ongoing violence in Manipur has resulted in 175 deaths and over 1,100 injuries in just four months, according to police reports. Disturbing incidents, such as the assault and stripping of two women by a mob, have been brought to light. Yet, there is a notable absence of youth gatherings or protests demanding justice and an end to the violence.</p>
<h2 id="the-spectator-sport-conundrum"><a class="header" href="#the-spectator-sport-conundrum">The Spectator Sport Conundrum</a></h2>
<p>Cricket's dominance as a spectator sport in India raises questions about the lack of participation in other sports.  The lack of sufficient playgrounds and funding for sports infrastructure means that the majority of Indians are relegated to the role of spectators rather than active participants. Should cricket be considered a true sport in India when the majority of people only watch and do not actively participate?</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-5"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-5">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>The Indian youth's obsession with cricket and lack of engagement in societal issues is concerning. While distractions like sports and entertainment are important, they should not come at the cost of apathy towards pressing matters. It is crucial for the youth to recognize their power and use it to address the challenges facing their country. True progress and change require an informed and active citizenry that goes beyond the "bread and circuses" mentality.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="nurture-vs-nature-the-complex-interaction-of-genes-and-environment"><a class="header" href="#nurture-vs-nature-the-complex-interaction-of-genes-and-environment">Nurture vs. Nature: The Complex Interaction of Genes and Environment</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/philosophy/understanding_feedback_loop.html">Feedback Loop for understanding free will</a></p>
<p>The age-old debate of nature versus nurture refers to the degree to which innate genetic factors (nature) and external environmental factors (nurture) influence our characteristics and behavior. This long-standing controversy has intrigued philosophers, scientists, and psychologists for centuries, sparking ongoing discussions and research in the field of biology and neuroscience. While it is clear that both factors play a role, unraveling their intricate interplay and relative contributions remains a complex task. In this article, we will delve into the latest insights from biology and neuroscience, exploring the fascinating ways in which nature and nurture constantly interact and shape who we are.</p>
<h2 id="the-classic-debate-nature-vs-nurture"><a class="header" href="#the-classic-debate-nature-vs-nurture">The Classic Debate: Nature vs. Nurture</a></h2>
<p>The nature versus nurture debate revolves around the question of innate traits versus learned behaviors. The "nature" side of the argument posits that our genetic makeup, inherited from our parents, largely determines our characteristics, behaviors, and personality traits. Proponents of this view believe that genes provide the blueprint for who we are and that much of our development is predetermined by our DNA. On the other hand, the "nurture" perspective emphasizes the influence of environmental factors such as upbringing, experiences, learning, and cultural influences on our development. Supporters of this view argue that our traits and behaviors are largely shaped by our interactions with the world around us.</p>
<h2 id="genetic-foundations-the-role-of-dna"><a class="header" href="#genetic-foundations-the-role-of-dna">Genetic Foundations: The Role of DNA</a></h2>
<p>In the realm of biology and neuroscience, significant advancements have been made in understanding the role of genetics in the nature versus nurture debate. It is now well-established that genes play a fundamental role in shaping our physical attributes, susceptibility to certain diseases, and even aspects of our behavior. For instance, genetic variations can influence traits such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10454093/">eye color</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9140854/">height</a>, and predisposition to specific health conditions.</p>
<p>Neuroscientific research has also identified links between certain genes and brain development, suggesting that genetics can impact cognitive abilities, mental health, and neurological disorders. For example, studies have found associations between specific genetic variations and conditions like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3052768/">Alzheimer's disease</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5545717/">dyslexia</a>. This indicates that our genetic makeup can indeed influence our brain function and behavior.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that genes are not the sole arbiters of our destiny. The concept of <a href="https://openstax.org/books/biology-2e/pages/16-3-eukaryotic-epigenetic-gene-regulation">epigenetics</a> has emerged as a crucial bridge between nature and nurture, illustrating how environmental factors can actually modify gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence. Epigenetic mechanisms involve processes such as DNA methylation and histone modification, which can turn genes "on" or "off," thereby influencing how cells read the genetic code. This means that experiences, lifestyle, and environmental conditions can all leave epigenetic marks on our genes, affecting their activity and ultimately influencing our traits and behaviors.</p>
<h2 id="environmental-influence-shaping-development"><a class="header" href="#environmental-influence-shaping-development">Environmental Influence: Shaping Development</a></h2>
<p>While genetics sets the foundation, environmental factors play a pivotal role in shaping our development. The field of neuroscience has particularly highlighted the impact of early experiences on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557811/">brain plasticity</a> and the formation of neural connections. For instance, enriching environments that provide stimulation and opportunities for learning have been shown to enhance cognitive development, whereas adverse experiences such as trauma or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2846096/">neglect can have detrimental effects on brain architecture and function</a>.</p>
<p>The concept of neuroplasticity, or the brain's ability to reorganize and form new neural connections, is central to understanding the impact of nurture. Neuroplasticity allows the brain to adapt and change in response to experiences, learning, and environmental stimuli. This dynamic process underlies our ability to acquire new skills, form memories, and adapt to changing circumstances. It also highlights the potential for environmental interventions to shape brain development and behavior.</p>
<p>Furthermore, social and cultural factors also play a significant role in shaping our behavior and personality. Our social interactions, cultural norms, and learned behaviors from our surroundings contribute to our development. For instance, language acquisition is heavily influenced by our environment, as we learn to communicate through exposure to language during early development. Cultural practices and beliefs also shape our values, behaviors, and perceptions of the world.</p>
<h2 id="the-interplay-gene-environment-interactions"><a class="header" href="#the-interplay-gene-environment-interactions">The Interplay: Gene-Environment Interactions</a></h2>
<p>The relationship between nature and nurture is not a simple dichotomy; instead, it is a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Gene-environment interactions refer to the ways in which our genetic makeup can influence our response to environmental stimuli, and vice versa. For example, certain genetic variations may increase susceptibility to a particular disease, but the presence of specific environmental triggers or risk factors is often necessary for the disease to manifest.</p>
<p>Additionally, the environment can also moderate the expression of genetic traits. For instance, while an individual may have a genetic predisposition towards a particular behavior, the manifestation of that behavior may depend on environmental influences. Similarly, environmental factors can impact the penetrance of a genetic trait, which refers to the likelihood that a particular genotype will result in the corresponding phenotype.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-embracing-the-complexity"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-embracing-the-complexity">Conclusion: Embracing the Complexity</a></h2>
<p>In conclusion, the nature versus nurture debate is far from resolved, and it is increasingly clear that a simplistic either-or approach does not suffice. Instead, biology and neuroscience have revealed a dynamic and intricate interplay between our genetic makeup and environmental influences. Our genes provide a foundation, but it is the ongoing interaction with our environment that shapes and refines our traits and behaviors. As such, a holistic understanding of human development requires consideration of both nature and nurture, recognizing the complex ways in which they intertwine and influence one another. Future research in these fields will undoubtedly continue to unravel the fascinating complexities of this age-old debate.</p>

<p>Criminals are not born but made. The court has made an important judgment affirming that a speedy trial is a fundamental right.</p>
<p>If the prosecuting agency can't ensure a speedy trial, they shouldn't oppose bail citing the seriousness of the offense: Supreme Court.</p>

<h4 id="contitutional-validity-of-pmla-1"><a class="header" href="#contitutional-validity-of-pmla-1">Contitutional Validity of PMLA</a></h4>
<p>Firstly, the constitutional validity of the PMLA is being challenged in the Supreme Court. The law has been criticized for being excessively harsh and disproportionate in its application, with many opposition politicians being targeted under it. The Supreme Court must examine the law's provisions and decide if they are constitutional or not. This case is of utmost importance, as the misuse of the PMLA and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has been a contentious issue in Indian politics.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-a-money-bill-1"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-money-bill-1">What is a Money Bill?</a></h4>
<p>Secondly, the status of the Money Bill is pending before the Supreme Court. The government has been accused of using the Money Bill route to pass unconstitutional laws without the scrutiny of the Rajya Sabha. The apex court must clarify the definition of a Money Bill and ensure that it is not misused by the government. This case is crucial for the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches of the government.</p>
<h4 id="ritu-chhabria-case-1"><a class="header" href="#ritu-chhabria-case-1">Ritu Chhabria Case</a></h4>
<p>In the Ritu Chhabria case, as per the law, an accused person is entitled to default bail if the charge sheet filed by the state is incomplete and requires further investigation under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The time period for an investigative agency to complete an investigation and file a charge sheet ranges from 60 to 90 days, depending on the type of crime. If the agency fails to complete the investigation within the stipulated time, the accused is entitled to default bail or automatic bail.</p>
<p>However, this is not happening. In order to defeat the right to default bail, investigative agencies these days file charge sheets despite not completing the investigation. This is done solely to keep the accused incarcerated for a longer period. As a result, the accused remains incarcerated for a long time, which is a clear violation of their rights and the principles of justice and fairness.</p>

<p>The root cause of every big problem in India is now the CJI and the judiciary, whether it's UAPA/PMLA, Money Bill, EVM, or NEET. It is the judiciary that has become a threat to our democracy.</p>
<p>One should learn from the USA: when corruption becomes rampant in the judiciary, impeachment should be pursued.</p>

Despite compelling evidence and widespread concerns regarding the potential flaws and vulnerabilities of EVMs, the Supreme Court rejected Public Interest Litigations (PILs) seeking a thorough investigation. Furthermore, the court denied requests to count all Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trails (VVPATs), an essential verification mechanism, without providing any satisfactory justification.</p>
<p>This example underscores the need for a paradigm shift in understanding power dynamics, as outlined in the pluralistic model of power. This model challenges the perception of power as monolithic or static, instead highlighting its fluid and dispersed nature. In any society, power dynamics can shift rapidly, and ultimately, power emanates from the people. Each individual possesses a small yet significant source of political power, and collectively, they have the agency to grant or revoke power from their rulers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Power in society ultimately comes from the people. And those people - each of whom is a small, individual source of political power - can change their minds. Rulers only have that power which people provide to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In democratic societies, power is ideally granted willingly by the people, but it can also be coerced or relinquished through apathy. Recognizing this dynamic, nonviolent campaigns play a pivotal role in empowering individuals to understand their capacity for change. When people unite and act in strategic, nonviolent ways, they can exert immense pressure on power structures and demand accountability.</p>
<p>The current situation calls for precisely such a response from the citizens. By questioning the legitimacy of the judiciary in the face of unjust decisions, people send a powerful message that they will not tolerate corruption or abuse of power. This sentiment is encapsulated in the pluralistic model of power, which asserts that rulers derive their power from the people and are therefore accountable to them.</p>

<p>In contemporary society, the role of politicians is not merely to serve as figureheads or spokespersons for their constituencies. Rather, they must be equipped with a comprehensive education to navigate the complex landscape of governance effectively. This necessity stems from the multifaceted nature of politics as a profession, one that demands specialized knowledge, ethical adherence, and the ability to make informed decisions that impact entire nations.</p>
<h3 id="politics-as-a-profession"><a class="header" href="#politics-as-a-profession">Politics as a Profession</a></h3>
<p>Professions are distinguished by their requirement for specialized knowledge, skills, and training, typically obtained through extensive education. Politics, akin to fields such as law, medicine, or engineering, requires a profound understanding of diverse subjects to perform competently. Politicians are entrusted with the monumental task of decision-making and resource allocation, responsibilities that necessitate a broad spectrum of knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="interdisciplinary-knowledge-and-its-importance"><a class="header" href="#interdisciplinary-knowledge-and-its-importance">Interdisciplinary Knowledge and Its Importance</a></h3>
<p>Politics is inherently interdisciplinary. A politician's role encompasses a wide array of fields, including economics, sociology, science, urban planning, and ethics. Each of these areas contributes to the effective governance of a country:</p>
<h4 id="economics"><a class="header" href="#economics"><strong>Economics</strong>:</a></h4>
<p>Understanding economic principles is crucial for crafting policies that promote growth, manage inflation, and reduce unemployment. Knowledge in this field ensures that politicians can make informed decisions about budgets, taxation, and public spending.</p>

<p>The more diverse the representatives in a government, the better equipped it is to address the multitude of issues that arise. Politicians with varied specializations bring different perspectives and expertise, leading to more comprehensive and effective policy-making. For instance, a politician with a background in environmental science can provide valuable insights into sustainable development, while one with a legal background can help navigate complex legislative processes.</p>
<h3 id="the-risks-of-inadequate-education"><a class="header" href="#the-risks-of-inadequate-education">The Risks of Inadequate Education</a></h3>

By valuing and prioritizing education for politicians, societies can cultivate leaders who are capable of addressing the multifaceted challenges of the modern world with competence, integrity, and foresight.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="statistics-behind-cheating"><a class="header" href="#statistics-behind-cheating">Statistics behind cheating</a></h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.barandbench.com/news/litigation/neet-ug-data-analytics-show-no-abnormalities-exam-results-centre-supreme-court">Central government</a> has said that data analytics conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras on the results of the National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) undergraduate 2024 show no abnormalities, and concludes that there is very less likelihood of malpractice having taken place.</p>
<p>"The marks distribution follows the bell-shaped curve that is witnessed in any large-scale examination indicating no abnormality...There is an overall increase in the marks obtained by students, specifically in the range of 550 to 720. This increase is seen across the cities and centres. This is attributed to 25% reduction in syllabus. In addition, candidates obtaining such high marks are spread across multiple cities and multiple centres, indicating very less likelihood of malpractice."</p>
<h2 id="absence-of-cheating-and-bell-curve"><a class="header" href="#absence-of-cheating-and-bell-curve">Absence of cheating and bell curve</a></h2>
<p>A bell curve in the distribution of marks doesn't necessarily indicate the absence of cheating. The bell curve, or normal distribution, suggests that most students scored around the average mark, with fewer students achieving very high or very low marks.</p>
<p>In large groups, individual instances of cheating might not significantly alter the overall distribution.</p>
<p>About 20 lakh students registered for the exam, and there are about <a href="https://www.vedantu.com/neet/government-mbbs-seats-through-neet">41,000 government seats</a>. Including private colleges, there are 78,000 seats in total. The percentage of students getting seats is 3.9%.</p>
<p>It's a minuscule number of seats, and the bell curve can hardly provide any insight if 4-10% of cheating has occurred, and they got the seats.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is no mention of standard deviation, variance, or the spread of data, whether it’s a flattened normal distribution or a squeezed normal distribution, based on exam history. Changes in variability can also suggest deviations from normal patterns of results.</p>
<p>According to the Center, marks do deviate from the usual history, but they suggest the reduction of the syllabus as the reason instead of cheating. How can they be so sure?</p>
<h2 id="mass-scale-manipulation-argument-is-vague"><a class="header" href="#mass-scale-manipulation-argument-is-vague">Mass scale manipulation argument is vague</a></h2>
<p>The argument regarding mass-scale manipulation is vague. In today's internet and mobile world, it takes just minutes for a leaked paper to spread. If it reaches even 10,000 to 20,000 students, the entire purpose of the examination is defeated, especially considering there are fewer than a lakh medical seats, and even fewer (41,000) government seats.</p>
<h2 id="what-statistics-researcher-use-for-detection-of-cheating"><a class="header" href="#what-statistics-researcher-use-for-detection-of-cheating">What statistics researcher use for Detection of Cheating?</a></h2>

<p>Person fit indices, such as U3 statistics, are used in educational measurement to detect irregular or unexpected response patterns, which might indicate cheating or malpractice during exams.</p>
<p>A high U3 value suggests that the person's responses deviate significantly from what the model predicts, which might indicate unusual behavior, such as cheating.</p>
<p>So, one has to map the item difficulties of each multiple-choice question and each student’s response for each MCQ. Such an analysis requires data from all answer sheets.</p>
<h2 id="the-opaque-govt"><a class="header" href="#the-opaque-govt">The Opaque Govt</a></h2>
<p>The government is neither making the data nor the analysis code public. How can we trust such analysis? This lack of transparency creates a low trust environment towards an opaque government. When data and methods are not openly shared, it becomes difficult for independent parties to verify the results or understand the processes used. This opacity fosters suspicion and undermines confidence in the government's findings and decisions. Transparency is crucial for building trust, ensuring accountability, and fostering a sense of reliability and integrity in governmental operations.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="citing-sources-to-criticize-is-not-copyright-violation"><a class="header" href="#citing-sources-to-criticize-is-not-copyright-violation">Citing sources to criticize is not copyright violation</a></h2>
<p>Recent events have brought to light a concerning trend of content censorship on online platforms, particularly on YouTube. Channels such as News Laundry, known for their critical and analytical content, have faced restrictions and even removal of their videos, because of copyright violations, but in reality due to their critical nature. This development raises serious concerns regarding the protection of free speech and the role of platforms in moderating content.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is essential to understand that citing sources for criticism falls under fair use principles. Fair use allows the use of copyrighted material for purposes such as criticism, news reporting, teaching, and research. By citing sources, creators are not claiming ownership of the content but rather using it as a reference to support their own original commentary and analysis. This practice encourages intellectual discourse and is a fundamental aspect of free speech.</p>
<p>However, the blurred lines between copyright protection and censorship have led to the misuse of content moderation tools by platforms like YouTube. While copyright laws are meant to protect the rights of creators, they should not be wielded as a weapon to silence dissent or suppress critical voices. Unfortunately, this is precisely what is happening in many cases, as content creators find their videos removed or demonetized, not because they have infringed on copyright, but because they have expressed opinions that some may find controversial or uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The consequences of this trend are far-reaching. It discourages content creators from engaging in critical discourse, fostering an environment of self-censorship. It also undermines the very essence of platforms like YouTube, which have long been celebrated as spaces for diverse voices and alternative perspectives. By silencing these voices, we risk losing the richness and variety of content that makes these platforms so valuable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the arbitrary nature of these content moderation decisions raises questions of transparency and accountability. Platforms often rely on automated systems or opaque guidelines to determine what constitutes acceptable criticism, leading to inconsistent and unfair enforcement. This lack of clarity creates an environment of uncertainty for content creators, who are left wondering if their next video will be targeted for expressing their opinions.</p>
<p>When citing sources for criticism, the primary purpose is to engage with the original work, provide context, and support arguments. This type of citation is essential for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing background information: Cite sources to establish the foundation of a topic, highlighting relevant research, theories, or debates.</li>
<li>Contrasting findings: Cite sources to demonstrate differences between your research and existing work, showcasing the significance of your contributions.</li>
<li>Building upon or challenging existing research: Cite sources to acknowledge the work of others, while also highlighting areas of agreement or disagreement.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these instances, citation is not solely driven by copyright concerns, but rather by the need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate understanding of the topic</li>
<li>Engage with the existing body of knowledge</li>
<li>Contribute to the ongoing conversation</li>
</ul>
<p>Key Characteristics</p>
<p>Criticism-driven citations often involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>In-depth analysis and evaluation of the original work</li>
<li>Identification of strengths and weaknesses</li>
<li>Comparison with other relevant sources</li>
</ul>
<p>These citations are typically longer and more nuanced than copyright-driven citations, as they require a deeper understanding of the original work and its significance.</p>
<p>By citing sources for criticism, you demonstrate academic integrity, respect for the original work, and a commitment to advancing knowledge in your field.</p>
<h2 id="freedom-of-speech-is-non-negotiable-and-the-role-of-courts"><a class="header" href="#freedom-of-speech-is-non-negotiable-and-the-role-of-courts">Freedom of speech is non-negotiable and the role of courts</a></h2>
<p>The role of the courts in safeguarding freedom of speech cannot be overstated, particularly when government overreach threatens to censor and silence critical voices. It is imperative that the judiciary actively intervenes to protect this fundamental right, enshrined in the constitution as a foundational principle. When the government requests censorship, the courts must not become passive spectators but instead uphold the truth and defend the freedoms guaranteed to all citizens.</p>
<p>The courts, as guardians of the Constitution, must uphold the fundamental right to free expression, ensuring that truth and transparency prevail over arbitrary power.</p>
<p>By intervening in cases of government-imposed censorship, the courts send a strong signal that freedom of speech is non-negotiable and that any attempts to curtail it will be scrutinized and challenged. This checks the power of the executive, holding them accountable to the people and the principles of a free and open society. It is through this proactive approach that the judiciary can fulfill its duty to defend the First Amendment rights of citizens and uphold the spirit of the Constitution.</p>

<p>In a world where gender inequality persists, it is crucial to emphasize the importance of gender equality education. This form of education isn't just a necessity for women; it's vital for society as a whole. Gender equality education lays the foundation for a more just and equitable society, where every individual, regardless of gender, has the opportunity to thrive. The absence of such education not only perpetuates systemic inequalities but also fuels the horrors women face in a male-dominated world.</p>
<h4 id="the-harrowing-reality-the-case-of-sanjay-roy"><a class="header" href="#the-harrowing-reality-the-case-of-sanjay-roy">The Harrowing Reality: The Case of Sanjay Roy</a></h4>
<p>The tragic case of Sanjay Roy, dubbed "The Beast of Kolkata," serves as a horrifying reminder of the brutality women endure in this world. Roy, a civic volunteer employee, committed an act of such inhumanity against a doctor that it sent shockwaves across the country. His crimes were not just a result of his addiction to alcohol or violent pornography, but a manifestation of deep-seated misogyny and the belief that women are inferior beings to be exploited and abused.</p>
<p>Roy's actions are emblematic of a larger issue. His history of violence, coupled with his lack of remorse, speaks volumes about the toxic masculinity that permeates our society. Despite marrying four times—his first three wives leaving him and the fourth dying of cancer—Roy's brutality went unchecked. It is likely that his wives, too, suffered from his cruelty, as so many women do in the shadows of their homes.</p>
<h4 id="the-culture-of-misogyny-why-do-men-like-sanjay-roy-exist"><a class="header" href="#the-culture-of-misogyny-why-do-men-like-sanjay-roy-exist">The Culture of Misogyny: Why Do Men Like Sanjay Roy Exist?</a></h4>
<p>Why do men like Sanjay Roy believe they have the right to do anything they want to a woman? Why do they feel entitled to suppress, exploit, and assault women as if it were their birthright? These are not isolated incidents but part of a larger, systemic problem.</p>
<p>The courage these men find to commit such atrocities stems from a society that normalizes misogyny. From a young age, boys are often taught that they are superior to girls, that a woman's place is beneath a man's. This toxic ideology is reinforced by media, cultural norms, and even the silence of institutions that fail to protect women. Whether it's stalking, catcalling, sexual harassment, or worse, these behaviors are often dismissed as "boys being boys," rather than recognized as the precursors to more severe violence.</p>
<h4 id="the-perpetual-struggle-will-crimes-against-women-ever-stop"><a class="header" href="#the-perpetual-struggle-will-crimes-against-women-ever-stop">The Perpetual Struggle: Will Crimes Against Women Ever Stop?</a></h4>
<p>The question that haunts us all is whether the crimes against half the population will ever cease. Will women ever truly be free from the savages, the brutes, the so-called "animals" of society? Every act of violence against a woman is not just an assault on her body but an assault on her dignity, her autonomy, and her right to live as a free and equal human being.</p>
<p>The violence women face is not just physical but also psychological, economic, and social. The discrimination against women in offices, the unequal representation in leadership roles, and the societal pressure to remain silent in the face of injustice all contribute to a culture that devalues women. This is why gender equality education is so important—it challenges these destructive norms and empowers individuals to stand up against them.</p>

<p>One of the most effective ways to combat this pervasive issue is through systemic change. Implementing a 50% representation for women in political and economic spheres is not just a step towards equality but a necessary action to prevent women from being treated as second-class citizens. Such reservations ensure that women have a voice in decision-making processes, helping to create policies that protect their rights and promote their welfare.</p>
<p>Increasing the number of women in political power brings numerous advantages, especially in the pursuit of justice for women. When more women hold positions of authority, they are more likely to prioritize issues that directly impact women, such as gender-based violence, discrimination, and access to healthcare. Women leaders often bring a unique perspective to policymaking, informed by their experiences and a deep understanding of the challenges women face. This can lead to the creation of laws and policies that address these challenges more effectively and swiftly. Furthermore, with more women in power, there is a greater likelihood of fostering a legal system that is more empathetic and responsive to the needs of women, ensuring that justice is not only served but is also delivered more quickly. This representation is crucial for breaking the cycle of impunity that often surrounds crimes against women and for creating a society where justice is accessible and equitable for all.</p>
<p>However, overthrowing the current system without a robust plan for what comes next is not the answer. We must ensure that any new government or system <a href="https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/do-we-need-a-supreme-leader-how-can-we-share-power-between-parties.html">incorporates approval voting, proportional representation, and about 50% representation of women in legislative assemblies</a>. This approach will prevent the replacement of one form of oppressive government with another, ensuring that history does not repeat itself.</p>
<h4 id="definition-of-gender-equality"><a class="header" href="#definition-of-gender-equality">Definition of Gender Equality</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Gender equality, also known as sexual equality or equality of the sexes, is the state of equal ease of access to resources and opportunities regardless of gender, including economic participation and decision-making; and the state of valuing different behaviors, aspirations, and needs equally, regardless of gender.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Gender equality doesn't mean that men and women are identical.</strong> <a href="https://stanmed.stanford.edu/how-mens-and-womens-brains-are-different/">Scientists routinely recognize that the presence or absence of a single DNA base pair can have significant medical implications. So, what about the impact of an entire chromosome?</a></p>
<p>Sex-based differences in brain structure and physiology result from the complex interactions of hormones and their receptors, the effects of these interactions within cells, and the mediating influence of genetic variables—especially the difference between having an XX versus an XY genotype.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion-7"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-7">Conclusion</a></h4>
<p>Gender equality education is not just important—it is essential. It is the key to dismantling the structures that allow men like Sanjay Roy to exist and thrive. By educating both men and women about the value of gender equality, we can create a society where women are no longer seen as objects to be dominated but as equals to be respected. Only then will we begin to see a world where women are truly free from the horrors they currently face.</p>

<p>Capital punishment is unethical and lacks empirical evidence as a solution.</p>
<p>While the West Bengal TMC government can be appreciated for taking proactive measures, such as attempting to introduce legislative bills addressing rape, they are not in denial mode like the BJP government, which tends to sweep the issue under the rug and becomes self-righteous when such incidents occur in non-BJP states, all while ignoring similar incidents in BJP-ruled states.</p>
<p>But is the <a href="https://www.barandbench.com/news/west-bengal-assembly-passes-anti-rape-bill-death-penalty-convicts">West Bengal anti-rape bill</a> on the table based on empirical evidence?</p>
<p>Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is the state-sanctioned killing of a person as punishment for actual or supposed misconduct.</p>
<h2 id="capital-punishment-lacks-a-deterrent-effect"><a class="header" href="#capital-punishment-lacks-a-deterrent-effect">Capital Punishment lacks a deterrent effect</a></h2>
<p>It's not about sympathizing with rapists; it's about recognizing that the death penalty is inhumane and lacks a deterrent effect.</p>
<p><a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/five-things-about-deterrence">Five Things About Deterrence</a></p>
<p>The certainty of being caught is a vastly more powerful deterrent than the severity of the punishment.</p>
<p>Research clearly shows that the likelihood of being caught is a much more effective deterrent than even the harshest punishments. Sending a convicted individual to prison isn’t a particularly effective way to deter crime.</p>
<p>Prisons are effective at punishing criminals and keeping them off the streets, but long sentences, in particular, are unlikely to deter future crime. In fact, prisons may have the opposite effect: those incarcerated often learn more effective crime strategies from each other, and time spent in prison may desensitize them to the threat of future imprisonment.</p>
<p>So, how can we increase the certainty of being caught? It’s about making the police, governance, and justice systems more robust. It’s about making the process more streamlined and efficient. If cases are filed only <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/woman-forced-to-dance-naked-raped-in-indore-5-booked/articleshow/113034865.cms">after weeks and court intervention</a>, something is very wrong with our police governance and accountability.</p>
<p>The proposal for a special police force called the "Aparajita Task Force" is a good start, but it’s crucial to ensure they are adequately resourced.</p>
<p><a href="https://scroll.in/article/1072870/bengals-anti-rape-law-will-actually-reduce-convictions-say-experts-heres-why">Higher the punishment, the less certain a conviction becomes. Bengal’s ‘anti-rape’ law will actually reduce convictions, say experts.</a></p>
<h2 id="human-a-biological-body-with-a-biological-brain"><a class="header" href="#human-a-biological-body-with-a-biological-brain">Human: A Biological Body with a Biological Brain</a></h2>
<p>It’s natural to get angry as we are biological beings, but we shouldn’t forget that our <a href="https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/understanding-free-will-and-how-it-can-impact-our-behavior.html">actions and reactions are based on molecular processes in our brain</a>. Criminal psychology can be studied in terms of environment and genetics, and how these factors impact the molecular processes of our brain.</p>
<p>Rapes and criminal psychology are being studied in research, and to bring about change we need to apply the research in practice, we need to address our regressive societal norms for women and prioritize mental health. Only then can we ensure that our workplaces, streets, and homes remain safe for women.</p>

<p>The education sector has seen a surge in the number of edupreneurs and stakeholders who claim to have revolutionary solutions to transform the way we learn. However, some of these individuals and organizations are doing more harm than good, often under the guise of innovation and disruption.</p>
<p>Many of these edupreneurs have jumped on the artificial intelligence (AI) bandwagon, either without fully <a href="https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/do-we-have-to-fear-machine-learning-or-ai.html">understanding the technology and its limitations</a> or deliberately exploiting the hype to secure venture capital (VC) funding. These VCs, in turn, promote the ideas they have invested in through aggressive marketing, often without empirical evidence to support their claims.</p>
<p>They claim that AI will ultimately replace teachers and make books and open educational resources obsolete, which is ironic, given that AI itself is trained on these very resources.</p>
<p>They tout buzzwords like "personalized learning," "discovery learning," "student-led learning," "problem-based learning," and "inquiry learning" as the future of education, without providing concrete evidence of their effectiveness. The assumption is that students can learn on their own, without the guidance of a teacher, using AI-based <a href="https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/programming/foss_philosophy.html">proprietary edtech tools</a>.</p>
<p>However, this assumption is flawed. Novice learners are not miniature experts, and what works for an expert usually doesn't work for a beginner. This is known as the expertise reversal effect (Sweller, Ayres, Kalyuga, &amp; Chandler, 2003), a reversal of the effectiveness of instructional techniques on learners with differing levels of prior knowledge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While an expert can be given a problem to be solved after having been taught a certain technique or principle, a novice should be given a more structured approach to using that principle for solving the same problem, for example in the form of a worked example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As learners progress, a fading procedure where steps in the solution procedure are gradually left open for the learner to complete on their own is more effective than an abrupt switch from worked examples to problems. This approach recognizes that learning is a gradual process that requires scaffolding and support, particularly in the early stages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is true that our education system has flaws that need to be addressed and criticized. However, this does not justify edupreneurs using these flaws as a pretext to introduce another precarious model that prioritizes their profits over improved learning outcomes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should be cautious of marketing gimmicks and critically evaluate the evidence behind these new approaches. It is essential to widely criticize and reject those that are not grounded in empirical evidence to prevent harm to our education system and, ultimately, to our students.</p>

<p>To mislead the laypeople, hateful messages will not work right from the start. The initial messages will focus on pride so that you get trapped in their trap.</p>
<p>You will be told that you should be proud of your race.</p>
<p>"Look at how great we Hindus were. We knew everything. Our history is the greatest in the world. And our culture is the best culture in the world."</p>
<h2 id="department-no-2-victimisation-and-self-pity"><a class="header" href="#department-no-2-victimisation-and-self-pity">Department No. 2: Victimisation and Self-Pity.</a></h2>
<p>Once you are baptised with pride and arrogance, then you are made into a victim.
You get messages which tell you that Hindus have been t0rtured for centuries.</p>
<p>"Look at how we are a victim. These people have not let us succeed for thousands of years.
Once you start believing in it, the next to attack is Department #3.</p>
<h2 id="department-no-3-you-are-in-danger"><a class="header" href="#department-no-3-you-are-in-danger">Department No. 3: You are in danger.</a></h2>
<p>"Not only have you been tortured for centuries, but you are still in danger."</p>
<p>Every week, every day, you are showered with false messages.</p>
<p>"Look at this, they will k!ll you inside your homes." "Look at what happened there." "Look at how they killed the sadhus there." "It can happen to you someday."</p>
<p>And who are these people who are after you? They are the people of other religions. And every anti-BJP person are said to be supporting them.</p>
<p>Congress, Aam Aadmi Party, every opposition party, Left-wing, Urban Naxal, George Soros,Pakistan, China, the USA, Russia, all the international agencies are against you.</p>
<p>You are in danger. And when this fear is stuffed inside you, Department #4 will come to save you. Modi's cult of personality.</p>
<h2 id="department-no-4-modis-cult-of-personality"><a class="header" href="#department-no-4-modis-cult-of-personality">Department No. 4: Modi's cult of personality</a></h2>
<p>Who will save you? Modi ji will come and save you. Modi ji is our lord and saviour. WhatsApp messages will make you believe that Modi is not a human being.</p>
<p>He is Krishna and Ram incarnate. Right before any election, the third and fourth
departments are the most active.</p>
<p>You will get WhatsApp messages. If you want to save Hindus, then you should vote for BJP only.</p>
<p>To create justification, countless false narratives will be created.</p>
<p>So, once again, in short, let's understand the chronology.</p>
<p>Department #1, you are great because you are a Hindu. Department #2, you have been oppressed for centuries. Department #3, you are in danger. And Department 4, Modi and BJP will be the ones to save you.</p>
<p>The emotional roller coaster you are put through, pay attention to how dangerous it is. First the emotion of pride and arrogance, then self-pity, and then hatred and fear.</p>

<p>North Korea is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea">a totalitarian dictatorship</a> with a comprehensive cult of personality around the Kim family. Amnesty International considers the country to have the worst human rights record in the world. Officially, North Korea is an "independent socialist state" which holds democratic elections; however, outside observers have described the elections as unfair, uncompetitive, and pre-determined, in a manner similar to elections in the Soviet Union.</p>
