= Step 1: Quit Big Tech Social Media

#set align(left)

Big tech social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have become breeding grounds for:
- Disinformation
- Polarization
- Voter manipulation
- Erosion of public trust

By quitting these platforms, we reduce their influence and break the cycle of algorithm-driven misinformation.


== Join Decentralized, Community-Moderated Alternatives

Two ethical, open-source alternatives:

- _Bluesky (AT Protocol)_
  A decentralized platform where users control their data and experience.

- _Mastodon (ActivityPub)_
  A federated network of independently run servers with community moderation.

ðŸ”¹ *These platforms promote free speech without sacrificing accountability.*


= Step 2: Reform the Voting System

Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) have raised concerns due to:
- Lack of transparency
- Potential for tampering
- No verifiable paper trail


== Demand VVPAT Slip in Hand + 100% Counting

Every voter should:
- Be able to verify their vote via handing over VVPAT slip and than putting it in ballot box
- Ensure that all VVPAT slips are counted manually

ðŸ›‘ If EVMs cannot be trusted, they should be banned altogether.

âœ… This ensures transparency, fairness, and public confidence in elections.


= The Outcome

#strong[If we follow these two steps:]
1. Quit big tech social media and join decentralized networks.
2. Demand full VVPAT verification and ban unverifiable EVMs.


We will:
- Stop disinformation at the source
- Reclaim democratic discourse
- Ensure fair and transparent elections

#strong[ðŸŒŸ Democracy can be restored by 100% by following these steps. ðŸŒŸ]
