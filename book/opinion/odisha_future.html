<p>What will you choose: rampant exploitation by big corporates or social welfare? Confused voters of Odisha have chosen the former.</p>
<p>The governance of the Modi-led BJP and the Naveen-led BJD is markedly different. One focuses on big corporates and privatization, while the other leans towards social welfare to some extent. Although the BJD may have its flaws, politics under the First-Past-the-Post (FPTP) voting system is not about choosing between good and evil, but rather between lesser evils. By opting for a more evil government over a less evil one, Odisha has made a significant mistake.</p>
<p>Odisha, among the 9 poorest states in India, has seen significant progress in reducing poverty under Naveen Patnaik's leadership. According to the Niti Aayog's Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report, poverty in Odisha reduced by 48% in the past five years. In 2022-23, only 11.07% of the state's population was considered multidimensionally poor.</p>
<p>While data may be questioned due to the lack of high-quality data in India, some conclusions can still be drawn, albeit not entirely accurate.</p>
<p>It is evident that the Modi-led government has been reluctant to conduct surveys and provide authentic, elaborate, and data-driven insights from thorough research based questionnaires.  This could have exposed inefficiencies in governance and invited criticism, so it seems that the government is more content with no data rather than quality data. Additionally, research funding for surveys has been limited.</p>
<h2 id="more-disinformation-in-odisha"><a class="header" href="#more-disinformation-in-odisha">More disinformation in Odisha</a></h2>
<p>India has become number one in spreading disinformation.</p>
<p>For example, to win the election, a campaign filled with bigotry and hatred was directed towards Pandian. By portraying the Tamil Pandian as a secret Chief Minister of Odisha and <a href="https://42683ff2b1a2ac5ad2fef0ee01995d78.ipfs.4everland.link/ipfs/bafybeiestxq2cmm6smn3gbuud4rsjswnoarc6zgyew2mh2od66745ftg4a">mocking the Tamil way of life</a>.</p>
<p>The BJP is adept at hate politics, as evidenced by their targeting of a Tamil Pandian who has lived and worked in the state for 20 years and speaks fluent Odia. They promote the idea that loyalty to the state should be determined by blood, which is a divisive and discriminatory ideology.</p>
<p>Do you prefer a candidate like Pandian from an independent regional party, or do you support a system where the chief minister and all other ministers and bureaucrats are mere bootlickers, remote-controlled by Modi and Shah? These bootlickers elevate Modi to the status of a god, placing him even above Lord Jagannath.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may end up with a Chief Minister who is <a href="https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/democracy/hinduism.html">ideologically driven by the RSS</a>, lacking the technical expertise to tackle complex economic issues, create jobs, and provide quality education. Moreover, such a leader may not possess the sociological understanding required to foster religious harmony, leading to potential social unrest. In contrast, an educated Chief Minister is essential to navigate the intricacies of governance, make informed decisions, and ensure the overall development of the state.</p>

<p>Do you prefer the South model, exemplified by Pandian, which is widely regarded as one of the most successful models in India, or do you opt for the Gujarat capitalist model, which boasts high education dropout rates, malnourished children, and exorbitant electricity bills? The choice between these two distinct models presents a clear contrast in priorities and outcomes.</p>
<p>Although there have been instances of collaboration between the BJP and the BJD, including the passing of bills that some may deem undemocratic, the BJD has largely maintained a safe distance from the BJP. Despite their occasional cooperation, the BJD has strived to preserve its independence and differentiate itself from the BJP's ideology and policies.</p>
<p>The trend of independent anchors resigning from TV news channels is concerning, BJP led govt in odisha paves the way for heightened propaganda and hatred in Odia news media. It appears that Odia news channels are emulating the model of national TV news channels during Modi's era of full majority, where biased and divisive content thrived. This development undermines journalistic integrity and sets a dangerous precedent for media manipulation in the state of Odisha.</p>
<p>The government will continue to exploit WhatsApp and other social media platforms to disseminate disinformation, conceal its flaws, and manipulate public opinion through emotional appeals. This tactic enables them to shape public perception and maintain control over the narrative, often at the expense of transparency and factual information.</p>

<p>As the influence of religious groups continues to grow in our society, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the political landscape is shifting in a manner that reflects this. With the rise of religious politics, we are seeing the implementation of measures such as curfews and internet shutdowns in an attempt to maintain order and control. While these actions may seem necessary to some, the long-term consequences of such restrictions can be detrimental to both individuals and the economy as a whole.</p>
<p><a href="../justice/internet-shutdown.html">Internet Shutdown is Anti-constitutional</a></p>
<p>Internet shutdowns, in particular, are a cause for concern. By cutting off access to the internet, essential communication channels, vital information sources, and online businesses are hindered. This not only affects the ability of citizens to stay connected and informed but also has a direct impact on the economy. Small businesses, freelancers, and entrepreneurs who rely on the internet to conduct their work can suffer significant financial losses during these shutdowns, leading to a potential decline in the economy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/28/in-2022-the-world-saw-187-internet-shutdowns-84-by-india-alone">In 2022, the world saw 187 internet shutdowns – 84 by India alone</a></p>
<p>Moreover, the normalization of curfews and internet shutdowns can lead to a further erosion of civil liberties and individual freedoms. As these measures become more commonplace, citizens may become desensitized to the infringement of their rights, ultimately allowing for more drastic and authoritarian policies to be enacted in the name of maintaining order.</p>

<p>Odisha, endowed with abundant mineral resources, faces the risk of rampant exploitation, which could endanger the livelihoods of tribal communities dependent on the forests. The state's mineral wealth has caught the attention of corporate giants like Adani, Ambani, and other conglomerates. While they may tout their activities as necessary for development, the reality is that the lives and ecosystems of tribal people are at stake. The propagation of pro-development propaganda through various media channels, including TV news, newspapers, and social media, serves to mask the potential detrimental impacts on the vulnerable communities and the environment.</p>

<p>Things seem to be now uncertain.</p>
<h2 id="education-system"><a class="header" href="#education-system">Education System</a></h2>
<p>The fate of the 5T schools, known for their improved infrastructure under Naveen's leadership, is uncertain under a BJP government led by Modi. The quality of education in Odisha under the leadership of Naveen remains questionable. However, it is worth acknowledging that the school infrastructure has witnessed some positive changes and improvements during his tenure. Modi, who has positioned himself as a divine, non-biological entity, promotes pseudoscience over scientific facts, as evidenced by his party's efforts to remove the theory of evolution from the curriculum. This raises concerns about the BJP's commitment to educational standards and their potential disregard for evidence-based learning.</p>
<h3 id="maharashtra-bjp-govt-may-lower-maths--science-pass-mark-to-20100"><a class="header" href="#maharashtra-bjp-govt-may-lower-maths--science-pass-mark-to-20100">Maharashtra (BJP Govt) may lower maths &amp; science pass mark to 20/100</a></h3>

<p>The move by the BJP government to consider lowering pass marks in Maharashtra, especially in critical subjects like math and science, indicates a troubling approach to education standards. In Maharashtra, the potential reduction of the pass mark for these subjects to 20 out of 100 reflects a shift away from fostering quality education and intellectual rigor. Math and science are fundamental disciplines that build critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills, essential not only for individual growth but also for societal advancement. Lowering standards undermines the value of these subjects, leaving students ill-prepared for the complexities of the modern world. These subjects are cornerstones of technological and scientific progress, which are essential for a nation’s development. Meanwhile, it appears the party may prioritize winning elections through divisive tactics, including religious conflict, disinformation, and indoctrination, over promoting scientific literacy and critical thought—skills necessary for a robust, enlightened democracy. This approach risks compromising the future of young learners and, ultimately, the progress of the nation itself.</p>
<h2 id="lakshmi-bus-scheme"><a class="header" href="#lakshmi-bus-scheme">Lakshmi bus scheme</a></h2>
<p>The BJP government was never a fan of public transport, that benefits the middle-class and poor, instead their policies are to build car centric infrastructure. The Lakshmi bus scheme is now under uncertainty. BJP government may not expand it further instead, busy is shutting down the services. Lakshmi bus is already shut down in Malkangiri.</p>
<h2 id="the-manifesto"><a class="header" href="#the-manifesto">The Manifesto</a></h2>
<p>Naveen made a promise to provide 100 units of free electricity, a feat that the BJP government would find difficult to replicate. Instead, there is evidence of a coal scam by corporates, leading to an increase in electricity prices beyond affordability.</p>
<p>Roof-top solar installations, led by the Modi government, are also questionable. Although the Modi government has done some good work on solar infrastructure, this too can be challenged as they are attempting to create a corporate-based solar grid to keep solar power under the control of corporations, rather than allowing people to run rooftop solar systems.</p>

<p>Distributing free money without addressing supply chain issues and controlling inflation and without taking account of state income is a form of electoral fraud, akin to vote buying.</p>
<h3 id="subhadra-yojana"><a class="header" href="#subhadra-yojana">Subhadra Yojana</a></h3>
<p>How will <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/odisha/bjd-mp-sulata-deo-calls-subhadra-yojana-an-election-gimmick-criticizes-limited-benefits-for-women/article68564892.ece">10,000 rupees per year help women</a> and the economy? With 10,000 rupees, one receives only 833 rupees per month. What can one do with 833 rupees? It can barely buy meals for two to three days. Furthermore, the excessive debts and printing of money will only further devalue the currency and decrease purchasing power. If the government provided rations with a fixed amount, we could ensure that the benefit would not fluctuate with changing prices. This promise of 833 rupees per month, without addressing supply chain issues and inflation, is nothing but an electoral gimmick and a fraudulent attempt to fool the people.</p>
<p>Additionally, the scheme has limited reach. With a female population of 2.25 crore in Odisha, the scheme only reaches 70 lakh women.</p>
<h2 id="free-money-and-hyperinflation"><a class="header" href="#free-money-and-hyperinflation">Free money and hyperinflation</a></h2>
<p>When a <a href="https://mru.org/courses/principles-economics-macroeconomics/zimbabwe-currency-inflation">government prints and distributes large amounts of free money</a> without addressing supply chain issues and inflation, it can lead to hyperinflation, where prices of goods and services increase rapidly. This occurs because the excess supply of money outpaces the supply of goods, causing each unit of currency to lose value. As prices rise, the purchasing power of individuals decreases, leading to increased debt as people borrow to maintain their standard of living. This cycle of printing more money to service the growing debt further exacerbates inflation, creating a vicious cycle that can ultimately lead to the destruction of an economy.</p>
<h2 id="the-bulldozer-government-destroying-local-businesses"><a class="header" href="#the-bulldozer-government-destroying-local-businesses">The Bulldozer Government: Destroying Local Businesses</a></h2>
<p>The BJP government has a track record of bulldozing small businesses, and their actions often leave local communities and entrepreneurs suffering. These road sides are often the lifeblood of local communities, providing a means for small business owners to support their families and offer convenient services to the public. What is the purpose of govt land? While it is true that road sides are typically government property, the purpose of such property is to serve the public. These entrepreneurs don't have the same opportunities and money  as large corporations to build supermarkets, and must instead make do with limited resources with roadside business. The destruction of the Bhadrak market, where countless shops have been bulldozed, is a prime example of the government's shortsighted and dictatorship approach. <a href="https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/road-planning-of-cities.html#city-traffic-sucks-they-should-widen-the-roads">Widening roads to accommodate cars</a> will never be enough, and the true loss is felt by those whose livelihoods are being destroyed in the name of "progress."</p>

<h2 id="suggestion-for-political-reform-in-bjd"><a class="header" href="#suggestion-for-political-reform-in-bjd">Suggestion for Political Reform in BJD</a></h2>
<p>Naveen Patnaik can no longer lead due to his old age. He is now 77 and suffers from various ailments. It's time for him to retire. But what will be the future of the BJD? Political parties have always depended on a single leader, and elections are fought based on that single leader's name. The defeat of the BJD was partly because the BJP highlighted that Naveen Patnaik is no longer able to lead, questioning how a Tamil from a different state could lead the BJD. Pandian is not Odia.</p>
<p>It's time for reform in the BJD. Leaders should be elected by party workers, and it's crucial to use <a href="https://electionscience.org/approval-voting-faqs/">Approval Voting</a> or Score Voting to select the leader, not the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) system. FPTP is a terrible voting method due to vote splitting; it is unlikely to yield the best leader or reflect the consensus of party workers and the people.</p>
<p>Additionally, decision-making needs to be more decentralized. The BJD can form evidence based <a href="https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacecfk7ruyr2cyk4px5o4op6tzdfnkwfzah3t5drrwxrftznfahhn3c?filename=Laloux%2C%20Frederic%20-%20Reinventing%20Organizations_%20A%20Guide%20to%20Creating%20Organizations%20Inspired%20by%20the%20Next%20Stage%20of%20Human%20Consciousness-Nelson%20Parker%20%282014%29.epub">teal organization to handle a self-managed system effectively</a> decreasing centralized decision-making.</p>

<h2 id="fptp-the-most-problematic-voting-method"><a class="header" href="#fptp-the-most-problematic-voting-method">FPTP: The Most Problematic Voting Method</a></h2>
<p>FPTP, or the first-past-the-post voting method, is indeed considered one of the most problematic voting systems. The example provided illustrates this issue well. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) secured 37.4% of the vote share but did not win any seats, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 20 out of 21 seats with a 45.4% vote share. It's a completely unfair distribution of seats. One can also consider the opaque EVM voting system and its potential for manipulation.</p>

<p>In the Odisha assembly election, have people actually voted for the BJP? The data suggests otherwise, as the vote percentage of BJD is more than that of BJP. Now, look at the data on seat share. The manipulation of EVMs is so evident.</p>

<p>Yes, its negative. BJD has more vote share than BJP.</p>
<h3 id="winner-won-majority-in-assembly-election"><a class="header" href="#winner-won-majority-in-assembly-election">Winner won majority in assembly election</a></h3>
<p>In 38 constituencies, the winner won the majority votes, while in 109 constituencies, the candidate who won did not get the majority votes.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/silicology/election_data_analysis/blob/main/data/2024_assembly/analysis/vote-splitting-odisha.json">Data</a></p>
<p>One can assume how terrible FPTP is. FPTP voting is most susceptible to EVM manipulation, and it's also terrible because it hardly considers what the majority of voters want. Moreover, it's antidemocratic because in 74.149% of constituencies, the representative didn't receive the majority of votes or the majority mandate from the people.</p>
<p>We need to start considering a more fair voting system, such as Approval Voting, that eliminates vote splitting.</p>
