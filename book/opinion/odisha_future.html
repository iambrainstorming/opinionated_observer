<p>What will you choose: rampant exploitation by big corporates or social welfare? Confused voters of Odisha have chosen the former.</p>
<p>The governance of the Modi-led BJP and the Naveen-led BJD is markedly different. One focuses on big corporates and privatization, while the other leans towards social welfare to some extent. Although the BJD may have its flaws, politics under the First-Past-the-Post (FPTP) voting system is not about choosing between good and evil, but rather between lesser evils. By opting for a more evil government over a less evil one, Odisha has made a significant mistake.</p>
<p>Odisha, among the 9 poorest states in India, has seen significant progress in reducing poverty under Naveen Patnaik's leadership. According to the Niti Aayog's Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report, poverty in Odisha reduced by 48% in the past five years. In 2022-23, only 11.07% of the state's population was considered multidimensionally poor.</p>
<p>While data may be questioned due to the lack of high-quality data in India, some conclusions can still be drawn, albeit not entirely accurate.</p>
<p>It is evident that the Modi-led government has been reluctant to conduct surveys and provide authentic, elaborate, and data-driven insights from thorough research based questionnaires.  This could have exposed inefficiencies in governance and invited criticism, so it seems that the government is more content with no data rather than quality data. Additionally, research funding for surveys has been limited.</p>
<h2 id="more-disinformation-in-odisha"><a class="header" href="#more-disinformation-in-odisha">More disinformation in Odisha</a></h2>
<p>India has become number one in spreading disinformation.</p>
<p>For example, to win the election, a campaign filled with bigotry and hatred was directed towards Pandian. By portraying the Tamil Pandian as a secret Chief Minister of Odisha and <a href="https://42683ff2b1a2ac5ad2fef0ee01995d78.ipfs.4everland.link/ipfs/bafybeiestxq2cmm6smn3gbuud4rsjswnoarc6zgyew2mh2od66745ftg4a">mocking the Tamil way of life</a>.</p>
<p>The BJP is adept at hate politics, as evidenced by their targeting of a Tamil Pandian who has lived and worked in the state for 20 years and speaks fluent Odia. They promote the idea that loyalty to the state should be determined by blood, which is a divisive and discriminatory ideology.</p>
<p>Do you prefer a candidate like Pandian from an independent regional party, or do you support a system where the chief minister and all other ministers and bureaucrats are mere bootlickers, remote-controlled by Modi and Shah? These bootlickers elevate Modi to the status of a god, placing him even above Lord Jagannath.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may end up with a Chief Minister who is <a href="https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/democracy/hinduism.html">ideologically driven by the RSS</a>, lacking the technical expertise to tackle complex economic issues, create jobs, and provide quality education. Moreover, such a leader may not possess the sociological understanding required to foster religious harmony, leading to potential social unrest. In contrast, an educated Chief Minister is essential to navigate the intricacies of governance, make informed decisions, and ensure the overall development of the state.</p>
<p><a href="https://thewire.in/communalism/new-odisha-cm-had-campaigned-for-release-of-graham-staines-killer-dara-singh">New Odisha CM Had Campaigned for Release of Graham Staines' Killer Dara Singh</a></p>
<p>Do you prefer the South model, exemplified by Pandian, which is widely regarded as one of the most successful models in India, or do you opt for the Gujarat capitalist model, which boasts high education dropout rates, malnourished children, and exorbitant electricity bills? The choice between these two distinct models presents a clear contrast in priorities and outcomes.</p>
<p>Although there have been instances of collaboration between the BJP and the BJD, including the passing of bills that some may deem undemocratic, the BJD has largely maintained a safe distance from the BJP. Despite their occasional cooperation, the BJD has strived to preserve its independence and differentiate itself from the BJP's ideology and policies.</p>
<p>The trend of independent anchors resigning from TV news channels is concerning, BJP led govt in odisha paves the way for heightened propaganda and hatred in Odia news media. It appears that Odia news channels are emulating the model of national TV news channels during Modi's era of full majority, where biased and divisive content thrived. This development undermines journalistic integrity and sets a dangerous precedent for media manipulation in the state of Odisha.</p>
<p>The government will continue to exploit WhatsApp and other social media platforms to disseminate disinformation, conceal its flaws, and manipulate public opinion through emotional appeals. This tactic enables them to shape public perception and maintain control over the narrative, often at the expense of transparency and factual information.</p>
<h2 id="normalizing-internet-shutdowns-and-curfews-amidst-the-rise-of-religious-politics"><a class="header" href="#normalizing-internet-shutdowns-and-curfews-amidst-the-rise-of-religious-politics">Normalizing Internet Shutdowns and Curfews Amidst the Rise of Religious Politics</a></h2>
<p>As the influence of religious groups continues to grow in our society, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the political landscape is shifting in a manner that reflects this. With the rise of religious politics, we are seeing the implementation of measures such as curfews and internet shutdowns in an attempt to maintain order and control. While these actions may seem necessary to some, the long-term consequences of such restrictions can be detrimental to both individuals and the economy as a whole.</p>
<p>Internet shutdowns, in particular, are a cause for concern. By cutting off access to the internet, essential communication channels, vital information sources, and online businesses are hindered. This not only affects the ability of citizens to stay connected and informed but also has a direct impact on the economy. Small businesses, freelancers, and entrepreneurs who rely on the internet to conduct their work can suffer significant financial losses during these shutdowns, leading to a potential decline in the economy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/28/in-2022-the-world-saw-187-internet-shutdowns-84-by-india-alone">In 2022, the world saw 187 internet shutdowns – 84 by India alone</a></p>
<p>Moreover, the normalization of curfews and internet shutdowns can lead to a further erosion of civil liberties and individual freedoms. As these measures become more commonplace, citizens may become desensitized to the infringement of their rights, ultimately allowing for more drastic and authoritarian policies to be enacted in the name of maintaining order.</p>

<h2 id="more-exploitation-of-resources"><a class="header" href="#more-exploitation-of-resources">More exploitation of resources</a></h2>
<p>Odisha, endowed with abundant mineral resources, faces the risk of rampant exploitation, which could endanger the livelihoods of tribal communities dependent on the forests. The state's mineral wealth has caught the attention of corporate giants like Adani, Ambani, and other conglomerates. While they may tout their activities as necessary for development, the reality is that the lives and ecosystems of tribal people are at stake. The propagation of pro-development propaganda through various media channels, including TV news, newspapers, and social media, serves to mask the potential detrimental impacts on the vulnerable communities and the environment.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-happen-to-the-welfare-schemes-of-naveen-led-govt"><a class="header" href="#what-will-happen-to-the-welfare-schemes-of-naveen-led-govt">What will happen to the welfare schemes of Naveen led Govt?</a></h2>
<p>What will happen to various welfare schemes like BSKY, Mamata Jojana, SHG group? </p>
<p>What will happen to public transport, Mo Bus, Lakhmi Bus?</p>
<p>Things seem to be now uncertain. </p>
<p>The fate of the 5T schools, known for their improved infrastructure under Naveen's leadership, is uncertain under a BJP government led by Modi. The quality of education in Odisha under the leadership of Naveen remains questionable. However, it is worth acknowledging that the school infrastructure has witnessed some positive changes and improvements during his tenure. Modi, who has positioned himself as a divine, non-biological entity, promotes pseudoscience over scientific facts, as evidenced by his party's efforts to remove the theory of evolution from the curriculum. This raises concerns about the BJP's commitment to educational standards and their potential disregard for evidence-based learning.</p>
<h2 id="the-manifesto"><a class="header" href="#the-manifesto">The Manifesto</a></h2>
<p>Naveen made a promise to provide 100 units of free electricity, a feat that the BJP government would find difficult to replicate. Instead, there is evidence of a coal scam by corporates, leading to an increase in electricity prices beyond affordability.</p>
<p>Roof-top solar installations, led by the Modi government, are also questionable. Although the Modi government has done some good work on solar infrastructure, this too can be challenged as they are attempting to create a corporate-based solar grid to keep solar power under the control of corporations, rather than allowing people to run rooftop solar systems.</p>

<h2 id="role-of-opposition"><a class="header" href="#role-of-opposition">Role of Opposition</a></h2>
<p>This time, the BJP, as a single party, has not secured a full majority in the center. The opposition has gained strength and their role is to expose the government's lies and prevent the situation from worsening.</p>
<h2 id="suggestion-for-political-reform-in-bjd"><a class="header" href="#suggestion-for-political-reform-in-bjd">Suggestion for Political Reform in BJD</a></h2>
<p>Naveen Patnaik can no longer lead due to his old age. He is now 77 and suffers from various ailments. It's time for him to retire. But what will be the future of the BJD? Political parties have always depended on a single leader, and elections are fought based on that single leader's name. The defeat of the BJD was partly because the BJP highlighted that Naveen Patnaik is no longer able to lead, questioning how a Tamil from a different state could lead the BJD. Pandian is not Odia.</p>
<p>It's time for reform in the BJD. Leaders should be elected by party workers, and it's crucial to use <a href="https://electionscience.org/approval-voting-faqs/">Approval Voting</a> or Score Voting to select the leader, not the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) system. FPTP is a terrible voting method due to vote splitting; it is unlikely to yield the best leader or reflect the consensus of party workers and the people.</p>
<p>Additionally, decision-making needs to be more decentralized. The BJD can form evidence based <a href="https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/bafykbzacecfk7ruyr2cyk4px5o4op6tzdfnkwfzah3t5drrwxrftznfahhn3c?filename=Laloux%2C%20Frederic%20-%20Reinventing%20Organizations_%20A%20Guide%20to%20Creating%20Organizations%20Inspired%20by%20the%20Next%20Stage%20of%20Human%20Consciousness-Nelson%20Parker%20%282014%29.epub">teal organization to handle a self-managed system effectively</a> decreasing centralized decision-making.</p>
<p>This approach can also be applied to other political parties, such as Congress or other regional parties.</p>
<h2 id="fptp-the-most-problematic-voting-method"><a class="header" href="#fptp-the-most-problematic-voting-method">FPTP: The Most Problematic Voting Method</a></h2>
<p>FPTP, or the first-past-the-post voting method, is indeed considered one of the most problematic voting systems. The example provided illustrates this issue well. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) secured 37.4% of the vote share but did not win any seats, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 20 out of 21 seats with a 45.4% vote share. It's a completely unfair distribution of seats. One can also consider the opaque EVM voting system and its potential for manipulation.</p>
