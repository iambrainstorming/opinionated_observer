# Elon Musk: A Problem for Society?

Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur behind companies like Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink, is often hailed as a visionary and a pioneer in technology and innovation. However, beneath the surface of his achievements lies a complex and controversial figure whose actions and ideologies have sparked significant criticism. From his personal life to his business practices and societal goals, Musk has become a polarizing figure, raising questions about his impact on society.

### Polygamy and Social Deviance

One of the most striking aspects of Musk's personal life is his approach to relationships and parenting. With at least 14 children from multiple partners, he could be considered polygamous, while the majority of people in the world are monogamous. His belief in marriage as an institution is highly doubtful.

#### Monogamy and Evolution

> 1) Although polygyny is socially sanctioned in most societies, monogamy is the dominant marriage-type within any one group cross-culturally.
> 2) while sex outside of marriage (or long-term partnerships) is common across societies, the actual rate of extra-pair paternity (EPP)—cases where a child is biologically fathered by someone other than the woman's social partner—is relatively low compared to other socially monogamous species, such as birds and some mammals.

### Parenting

With 14 children, it is unlikely that he could provide the level of parental care expected of a father, leaving much of the responsibility to the children's mothers. As a billionaire and one of the busiest people in the world, he hardly has time for parenting, which is an incredibly time-consuming process.

Sadly, he advocates for having many children, seemingly unaware of the immense effort and commitment required for proper parental care in a monogamous family structure.

Monogamous relationships play a critical role in facilitating paternal care, which is essential for the survival and development of offspring. While paternal care is rare in the animal kingdom, it is widespread in human societies. Monogamy not only supports paternal care but also strengthens the pair bond, ensuring long-term investment in offspring well-being.

### Women Mental Health

The current state of the research reveals with moderate confidence, a more significant prevalence of mental-health issues in polygynous women as compared to monogamous women. Implications for practice and research are indicated.

### Dystopian Goals for Society

Elon Musk may be academically accomplished in technology, but his vision for society often appears dystopian.


#### Unsustainable Car-Centric Infrastructure

Musk prioritizes car-centric solutions, such as electric vehicles, over developing affordable and efficient public transportation systems. This approach neglects the need for greener urban spaces that prioritize trees, bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly areas, which are essential for sustainable living.

#### Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)

His Neuralink project aims to merge human brains with computers, raising serious concerns about the erosion of human agency and privacy. This technology risks turning humans into semi-robotic entities, stripping away the autonomy that defines us. Furthermore, the [ethical implications of animal testing and killing monkeys](

While Neuralink claims to cure neurological disorders, this ambition overlooks the complexity of how the human brain develops—from the moment an ovum is fertilized to adulthood. The brain's intricate wiring and adaptability make such interventions highly impractical. For instance, individuals born blind often face challenges not with their eyes but with their brain's ability to process visual information. Simply transplanting a cornea or even an entire eye cannot restore vision, as the brain lacks the neural pathways to interpret the input. Musk's vision, while technologically ambitious, often disregards the nuanced realities of human biology and societal needs.

### Disinformation and Control of Narratives

Musk's acquisition of Twitter (now X) has further cemented his role as a controversial figure. By taking control of one of the world's most influential social media platforms, Musk has positioned himself as a gatekeeper of information. His actions on the platform, including attacks on climate change activists, researchers, and the LGBTQ+ community, reveal a pattern of using his power to suppress dissent and promote his own agenda.

Despite his polygamous lifestyle and being a social deviant himself, Musk has taken positions that are hostile to LGBTQ+ communities. His rhetoric and policies on X (formerly Twitter) have amplified anti-trans voices and spread misinformation.

Musk's behavior aligns with traits commonly associated with [narcissistic psychopathy](https://youtu.be/kyow7KAHDks?si=twZlQGqXWbEwK53l), characterized by a lack of empathy, a desire for control, and a belief that money and power can bend the world to his will. His attempts to shape public discourse and silence opposing voices have led many to seek alternative platforms like BlueSky and Mastodon, where billionaires cannot exert the same level of control. This shift reflects a growing resistance to Musk's influence and a desire for more democratic and decentralized spaces.
