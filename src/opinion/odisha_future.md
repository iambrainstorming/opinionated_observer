# Odisha's future for the next five years looks gloomy with the change in government.


What will you choose: rampant exploitation by big corporates or social welfare? Confused voters of Odisha have chosen the former.

The governance of the Modi-led BJP and the Naveen-led BJD is markedly different. One focuses on big corporates and privatization, while the other leans towards social welfare to some extent. Although the BJD may have its flaws, politics under the First-Past-the-Post (FPTP) voting system is not about choosing between good and evil, but rather between lesser evils. By opting for a more evil government over a less evil one, Odisha has made a significant mistake.

Odisha, among the 9 poorest states in India, has seen significant progress in reducing poverty under Naveen Patnaik's leadership. According to the Niti Aayog's Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report, poverty in Odisha reduced by 48% in the past five years. In 2022-23, only 11.07% of the state's population was considered multidimensionally poor.

While data may be questioned due to the lack of high-quality data in India, some conclusions can still be drawn, albeit not entirely accurate.

It is evident that the Modi-led government has been reluctant to conduct surveys and provide authentic, elaborate, and data-driven insights from thorough research based questionnaires.  This could have exposed inefficiencies in governance and invited criticism, so it seems that the government is more content with no data rather than quality data. Additionally, research funding for surveys has been limited.

## More disinformation in Odisha

India has become number one in spreading disinformation.

For example, to win the election, a campaign filled with bigotry and hatred was directed towards Pandian. By portraying the Tamil Pandian as a secret Chief Minister of Odisha and mocking the Tamil way of life.

The BJP is adept at hate politics, as evidenced by their targeting of a Tamil Pandian who has lived and worked in the state for 20 years and speaks fluent Odia. They promote the idea that loyalty to the state should be determined by blood, which is a divisive and discriminatory ideology.

Do you prefer a candidate like Pandian from an independent regional party, or do you support a system where the chief minister and all other ministers and bureaucrats are mere bootlickers, remote-controlled by Modi and Shah? These bootlickers elevate Modi to the status of a god, placing him even above Lord Jagannath.

Do you prefer the South model, exemplified by Pandian, which is widely regarded as one of the most successful models in India, or do you opt for the Gujarat capitalist model, which boasts high education dropout rates, malnourished children, and exorbitant electricity bills? The choice between these two distinct models presents a clear contrast in priorities and outcomes.


Although there have been instances of collaboration between the BJP and the BJD, including the passing of bills that some may deem undemocratic, the BJD has largely maintained a safe distance from the BJP. Despite their occasional cooperation, the BJD has strived to preserve its independence and differentiate itself from the BJP's ideology and policies.

The trend of independent anchors resigning from TV news channels is concerning, BJP led govt in odisha paves the way for heightened propaganda and hatred in Odia news media. It appears that Odia news channels are emulating the model of national TV news channels during Modi's era of full majority, where biased and divisive content thrived. This development undermines journalistic integrity and sets a dangerous precedent for media manipulation in the state of Odisha.


The government will continue to exploit WhatsApp and other social media platforms to disseminate disinformation, conceal its flaws, and manipulate public opinion through emotional appeals. This tactic enables them to shape public perception and maintain control over the narrative, often at the expense of transparency and factual information.


## More exploitation of resources

Odisha, endowed with abundant mineral resources, faces the risk of rampant exploitation, which could endanger the livelihoods of tribal communities dependent on the forests. The state's mineral wealth has caught the attention of corporate giants like Adani, Ambani, and other conglomerates. While they may tout their activities as necessary for development, the reality is that the lives and ecosystems of tribal people are at stake. The propagation of pro-development propaganda through various media channels, including TV news, newspapers, and social media, serves to mask the potential detrimental impacts on the vulnerable communities and the environment.

## What will happen to the welfare schemes of Naveen led Govt?

What will happen to various welfare schemes like BSKY, Mamata Jojana, SHG group? 

What will happen to public transport, Mo Bus, Lakhmi Bus?

Things seem to be now uncertain. 

The fate of the 5T schools, known for their improved infrastructure under Naveen's leadership, is uncertain under a BJP government led by Modi. The quality of education in Odisha under the leadership of Naveen remains questionable. However, it is worth acknowledging that the school infrastructure has witnessed some positive changes and improvements during his tenure. Modi, who has positioned himself as a divine, non-biological entity, promotes pseudoscience over scientific facts, as evidenced by his party's efforts to remove the theory of evolution from the curriculum. This raises concerns about the BJP's commitment to educational standards and their potential disregard for evidence-based learning.

## The Manifesto
Naveen made a promise to provide 100 units of free electricity, a feat that the BJP government would find difficult to replicate. Instead, there is evidence of a coal scam by corporates, leading to an increase in electricity prices beyond affordability.

Roof-top solar installations, led by the Modi government, are also questionable. Although the Modi government has done some good work on solar infrastructure, this too can be challenged as they are attempting to create a corporate-based solar grid to keep solar power under the control of corporations, rather than allowing people to run rooftop solar systems.

[The manifesto pledged to extend BJD Governmentâ€™s flagship BSKY health insurance to middle class families, government employees and contractual employees in a phased manner.](https://42683ff2b1a2ac5ad2fef0ee01995d78.ipfs.4everland.link/ipfs/bafkreihz4zkxqyhcdlctypui7gqy36hjnrn7bqxi4oxjixivqsplhohz5a)
BJD was also implementing it before election through Naveen card, will BJP bring such health care benefits to middle class?

Tall claims by [BJP of 300 units of free electricity](https://42683ff2b1a2ac5ad2fef0ee01995d78.ipfs.4everland.link/ipfs/bafybeifoniiv4kutl6mjpjgmcyk3jiujd7g5u4bv4whqa56h67uct32ahy), but no mention of it in their manifesto.

> We will provide free electricity up to 100 units for every antyodaya household.

Who are antyodaya household, is it 0.1% of people, 1% of people or even less or more?

## Role of Opposition

This time, the BJP, as a single party, has not secured a full majority in the center. The opposition has gained strength and their role is to expose the government's lies and prevent the situation from worsening.
