# Why Many Edupreneurs and Stakeholders in Education Do More Harm Than Good

The education sector has seen a surge in the number of edupreneurs and stakeholders who claim to have revolutionary solutions to transform the way we learn. However, some of these individuals and organizations are doing more harm than good, often under the guise of innovation and disruption.

Many of these edupreneurs have jumped on the artificial intelligence (AI) bandwagon, either without fully [understanding the technology and its limitations](https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/do-we-have-to-fear-machine-learning-or-ai.html) or deliberately exploiting the hype to secure venture capital (VC) funding. These VCs, in turn, promote the ideas they have invested in through aggressive marketing, often without empirical evidence to support their claims.

They tout buzzwords like "personalized learning," "discovery learning," "student-led learning," "problem-based learning," and "inquiry learning" as the future of education, without providing concrete evidence of their effectiveness. The assumption is that students can learn on their own, without the guidance of a teacher, using AI-based [proprietary edtech tools](https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/programming/foss_philosophy.html).

They claim that AI will ultimately replace teachers and make books and open educational resources obsolete, which is ironic, given that AI itself is trained on these very resources.

However, this assumption is flawed. Novice learners are not miniature experts, and what works for an expert usually doesn't work for a beginner. This is known as the expertise reversal effect (Sweller, Ayres, Kalyuga, & Chandler, 2003), a reversal of the effectiveness of instructional techniques on learners with differing levels of prior knowledge. 

> While an expert can be given a problem to be solved after having been taught a certain technique or principle, a novice should be given a more structured approach to using that principle for solving the same problem, for example in the form of a worked example.

As learners progress, a fading procedure where steps in the solution procedure are gradually left open for the learner to complete on their own is more effective than an abrupt switch from worked examples to problems. This approach recognizes that learning is a gradual process that requires scaffolding and support, particularly in the early stages.

> It is true that our education system has flaws that need to be addressed and criticized. However, this does not justify edupreneurs using these flaws as a pretext to introduce another precarious model that prioritizes their profits over improved learning outcomes.

We should be cautious of marketing gimmicks and critically evaluate the evidence behind these new approaches. It is essential to widely criticize and reject those that are not grounded in empirical evidence to prevent harm to our education system and, ultimately, to our students.
