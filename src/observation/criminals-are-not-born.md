Criminals are not born but made. The court has made an important judgment affirming that a speedy trial is a fundamental right.

If the prosecuting agency can't ensure a speedy trial, they shouldn't oppose bail citing the seriousness of the offense: Supreme Court.

"Innocent until proven guilty" cannot be ruled out, no matter how stringent the penal law may be.

> But will this be applicable to all citizens? Does the court follow the rule of law? With crores of cases pending, many don't even get a hearing. It is difficult to get a hearing, with dates getting delayed repeatedly.

For example, in seven years, [10,552 Indians have been arrested under UAPA](https://scroll.in/article/1010530/in-seven-years-10552-indians-have-been-arrested-under-uapa-and-253-convicted)â€“ but only 253 have been convicted.
