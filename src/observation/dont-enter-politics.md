## Why Don't Educated Indians Enter Politics?

In India, a peculiar trend persists: highly educated individuals often shun politics. Instead, parents overwhelmingly push their children towards becoming IAS officers. But why?

### The Allure of Entrance Exams
Becoming an IAS officer involves passing one of the most grueling entrance exams in the country. This exam, with its bullshit rote learning and formulaic testing, offers immense satisfaction to those who clear it, knowing they have succeeded where 99.9% have failed. The competitive nature of the exam, with only 0.1% of candidates passing, offers a sense of accomplishment that is unmatched by the relatively straightforward process of entering politics. In elections for Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) or Members of Parliament (MPs), there are typically only 5–8 candidates on the ballot, which lacks the intense competition seen in the IAS exam. Who will compete with a handful of candidates on the ballot? We will compete in terms of millions. In politics, the satisfaction of winning against millions isn't present, reducing the allure. Moreover, while the flaws of the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) voting system are well-known by experts, few seem to focus on improving it.

### Job Security
Indians have a deep-seated obsession with job security, favoring government jobs that promise permanence. The IAS offers such security; once you pass the entrance exam, your future is secure. However, the path to becoming an IAS officer involves taking a much bigger risk than entering politics, with a daunting 99.9% failure rate. Despite these odds, many prefer this route, driven by the belief that once the entrance is cracked, life is set. In stark contrast, political positions are inherently risky, with terms lasting only a few years. Even though the salary of MPs, MLAs, or Sarpanchs is less than that of IAS officers, being a politician allows one to make significant contributions that can last for ages. Ironically, politicians have the power to set their own salaries through consensus of people, yet this doesn’t seem to attract educated individuals.

### The Bandwagon Effect
The bandwagon effect, where people follow trends simply because others are doing so, plays a significant role. If everyone is striving to become an IAS officer, individuals feel compelled to join the rat race, avoiding the less-trodden path of politics.

### Prestige
The IAS is viewed as a prestigious position, largely due to the bandwagon effect. On the other hand, politics comes with daily criticism and scrutiny. Despite the fact that IAS officers are often controlled by politicians who can transfer them at will if they don't listen to them and can't survive without corruption.
