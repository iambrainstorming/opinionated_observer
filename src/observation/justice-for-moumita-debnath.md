### The Importance of Gender Equality Education and the Torture Women Face in a Man's World

In a world where gender inequality persists, it is crucial to emphasize the importance of gender equality education. This form of education isn't just a necessity for women; it's vital for society as a whole. Gender equality education lays the foundation for a more just and equitable society, where every individual, regardless of gender, has the opportunity to thrive. The absence of such education not only perpetuates systemic inequalities but also fuels the horrors women face in a male-dominated world.

#### The Harrowing Reality: The Case of Sanjay Roy

The tragic case of Sanjay Roy, dubbed "The Beast of Kolkata," serves as a horrifying reminder of the brutality women endure in this world. Roy, a civic volunteer employee, committed an act of such inhumanity against a doctor that it sent shockwaves across the country. His crimes were not just a result of his addiction to alcohol or violent pornography, but a manifestation of deep-seated misogyny and the belief that women are inferior beings to be exploited and abused.

Roy's actions are emblematic of a larger issue. His history of violence, coupled with his lack of remorse, speaks volumes about the toxic masculinity that permeates our society. Despite marrying four times—his first three wives leaving him and the fourth dying of cancer—Roy's brutality went unchecked. It is likely that his wives, too, suffered from his cruelty, as so many women do in the shadows of their homes.

#### The Culture of Misogyny: Why Do Men Like Sanjay Roy Exist?

Why do men like Sanjay Roy believe they have the right to do anything they want to a woman? Why do they feel entitled to suppress, exploit, and assault women as if it were their birthright? These are not isolated incidents but part of a larger, systemic problem.

The courage these men find to commit such atrocities stems from a society that normalizes misogyny. From a young age, boys are often taught that they are superior to girls, that a woman's place is beneath a man's. This toxic ideology is reinforced by media, cultural norms, and even the silence of institutions that fail to protect women. Whether it's stalking, catcalling, sexual harassment, or worse, these behaviors are often dismissed as "boys being boys," rather than recognized as the precursors to more severe violence.

#### The Perpetual Struggle: Will Crimes Against Women Ever Stop?

The question that haunts us all is whether the crimes against half the population will ever cease. Will women ever truly be free from the savages, the brutes, the so-called "animals" of society? Every act of violence against a woman is not just an assault on her body but an assault on her dignity, her autonomy, and her right to live as a free and equal human being.

The violence women face is not just physical but also psychological, economic, and social. The discrimination against women in offices, the unequal representation in leadership roles, and the societal pressure to remain silent in the face of injustice all contribute to a culture that devalues women. This is why gender equality education is so important—it challenges these destructive norms and empowers individuals to stand up against them.

#### The Solution: 50% Women Reservation and Systemic Change

One of the most effective ways to combat this pervasive issue is through systemic change. Implementing a 50% reservation for women in political and economic spheres is not just a step towards equality but a necessary action to prevent women from being treated as second-class citizens. Such reservations ensure that women have a voice in decision-making processes, helping to create policies that protect their rights and promote their welfare.

Increasing the number of women in political power brings numerous advantages, especially in the pursuit of justice for women. When more women hold positions of authority, they are more likely to prioritize issues that directly impact women, such as gender-based violence, discrimination, and access to healthcare. Women leaders often bring a unique perspective to policymaking, informed by their experiences and a deep understanding of the challenges women face. This can lead to the creation of laws and policies that address these challenges more effectively and swiftly. Furthermore, with more women in power, there is a greater likelihood of fostering a legal system that is more empathetic and responsive to the needs of women, ensuring that justice is not only served but is also delivered more quickly. This representation is crucial for breaking the cycle of impunity that often surrounds crimes against women and for creating a society where justice is accessible and equitable for all.

However, overthrowing the current system without a robust plan for what comes next is not the answer. We must ensure that any new government or system [incorporates approval voting, proportional representation, and adequate representation of women](https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/do-we-need-a-supreme-leader-how-can-we-share-power-between-parties.html). This approach will prevent the replacement of one form of oppressive government with another, ensuring that history does not repeat itself.

#### Conclusion

Gender equality education is not just important—it is essential. It is the key to dismantling the structures that allow men like Sanjay Roy to exist and thrive. By educating both men and women about the value of gender equality, we can create a society where women are no longer seen as objects to be dominated but as equals to be respected. Only then will we begin to see a world where women are truly free from the horrors they currently face.
