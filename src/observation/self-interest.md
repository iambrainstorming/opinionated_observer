# Do we work with self-interest?

## Why don't we make informed choices?

The concept of self-interest is a fundamental assumption in economics, where it is believed that individuals make decisions that maximize their own benefits and satisfaction. Economists use this assumption to build models that predict human behavior, particularly in relation to consumption and resource allocation. However, the question of whether people truly act in their own self-interest is a complex one?

While individuals may sometimes prioritize their own self-interest, there are many instances where they don't. Furthermore, their self-interest can occasionally come into conflict with the greater good, resulting in decisions that harm the community and, ironically, themselves.

Many people engage in altruistic behaviors, such as volunteering or donating to charity, which suggests that their self-interest may not always be the primary consideration.

Furthermore, some individuals may prioritize the well-being of their community or the environment over their own personal interests, recognizing that their own well-being is often inextricably linked to the greater good.

In reality, human behavior is influenced by a multitude of factors, including emotions, social norms, and cultural values. While self-interest may play a role in decision-making, it is not the sole driver of human action.

Moreover, identifying one's self-interest can be a challenging task that requires a significant amount of knowledge, experimentation, and critical thinking. It involves weighing the potential benefits and drawbacks of different choices and considering how they may impact one's own life, as well as the lives of others. 

Unfortunately, people often prioritize their own biases and uninformed opinions over their true self-interest, leading to decisions that can have negative consequences for both themselves and those around them. 

However, most individuals are not that resourceful, or do not have enough knowledge to make informed choices. Additionally, knowledge is not enough; it is not even half the battle. Putting knowledge into practice requires a high amount of grit and forming a habit.

This highlights the need for education, critical thinking, and informed decision-making to ensure that individuals are able to make choices that align with their own self-interest and contribute to the greater good.

By acknowledging the complexity of human decision-making and the many factors that influence it, we can work towards creating a more nuanced understanding of self-interest and its role in shaping our choices and actions.
