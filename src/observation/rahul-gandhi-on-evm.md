# Why is Leader of Oppostion Rahul Gandhi Silent on EVM issues?


The debate around Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and their alleged vulnerabilities has persisted now for years in India. We wonder why Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the opposition and a most prominent figure in Indian politics, has not taken a decisive stand on this crucial issue. His perceived inaction raises questions about his leadership approach, political strategy, and commitment to electoral integrity.

## Misguided by Close Party Leaders?

A potential reason for Rahul Gandhi’s apparent indecision could be reliance on advice from close party leaders who might downplay the significance of addressing EVM-related concerns. If these advisors believe raising the issue might backfire or appear as an excuse for electoral losses, it could explain his reluctance. However, ignoring legitimate concerns about EVM security undermines the trust of both party workers and the electorate.

Moreover, many of these close party leaders are rumored to have connections with the party in power. While appearing to be on Rahul Gandhi’s side, they may deliberately misguide him, steering him away from addressing critical issues like EVM fraud. Such duplicitous behavior not only weakens the opposition's ability to mount an effective challenge but also deepens mistrust within the party ranks.

## Overlooking Flaws in EVMs?

The flaws of secretive EVM systems are well-documented, with concerns about hacking, tampering, and lack of transparency repeatedly raised by opposition parties, activists, and technologists. Does Rahul Gandhi not grasp the gravity of these issues? Or does he underestimate their impact on India's democratic processes? As a leader expected to champion democratic values, his silence is disappointing, especially when the integrity of elections—the cornerstone of any democracy—is in question.

## Wishful Thinking or Political Strategy?

Another possibility is that Rahul Gandhi is engaging in wishful thinking, hoping that power will eventually swing back to Congress without directly addressing EVM concerns. If this is the case, it reflects a dangerous complacency. Ignoring systemic issues like EVM vulnerabilities risks perpetuating electoral outcomes that may not accurately reflect the people's will.

## Secret Motives or Lack of Will?

Some might speculate that Rahul Gandhi's inaction could stem from internal party dynamics or undisclosed strategic reasons. Is he avoiding the topic to prevent controversy, or does he lack the political will to take a firm stand? If so, this approach raises serious doubts about his commitment to the party’s and the nation’s best interests.

Further speculation suggests more troubling possibilities. Could Rahul Gandhi be under pressure due to blackmail? Is there a fear that certain corrupt dealings or sensitive secrets might be exposed if he challenges the EVM issue too forcefully? Such a scenario, if true, would highlight a serious vulnerability in leadership and raise questions about external influences compromising his ability to act independently.

Another possibility is a behind-the-scenes compromise with corporate entities or the party in power. In a political climate where large businesses wield significant influence, it’s plausible that tacit agreements have been made to maintain the status quo. If there is any truth to this, it would reflect a betrayal of public trust and the foundational principles of democracy.

## Flawed Priorities: Focusing on Caste Census Over EVM Concerns

Rahul Gandhi's focus on pushing for a caste census, while ignoring the pressing issue of EVM integrity, reflects flawed priorities. Without securing the democratic structure that ensures free and fair elections, the relevance of a caste census becomes questionable. A caste census may have its merits, but its execution requires a robust and balanced democratic framework where power is not centralized or manipulated. Addressing EVM vulnerabilities should be the first step in restoring electoral credibility and ensuring that policies like the caste census are implemented in a fair and transparent system. Without this foundation, even well-intentioned initiatives risk being undermined.

## Parliament Disrupted for Adani, But Not for Electoral Integrity

Parliament is frequently disrupted over allegations of corruption involving Adani, but how many times has the opposition protested against EVM manipulation or shut down the parliament to demand electoral reforms? This silence raises questions about the opposition's commitment to electoral integrity. Rahul Gandhi often states that there is no level playing field in India, as all resources are allegedly channeled to Adani, a close ally of Prime Minister Modi. However, the opposition can only create a level playing field if they win elections. To achieve that, they must first address the fundamental issue of fair elections by challenging the vulnerabilities of EVMs. Without this fight, their actions appear more like a [spectacle or circus for public entertainment](https://42683ff2b1a2ac5ad2fef0ee01995d78.ipfs.4everland.link/ipfs/bafybeifkhqxrbebc36rr7t3qbvxahewgo4u7xhg2llzuf3abvhhjttmihq) rather than a serious effort to safeguard democracy.

## The Threat to Democracy

The consequences of inaction on EVM integrity are dire. Without a credible and transparent voting process, the country risks sliding toward authoritarianism. Despite opposition parties collectively receiving over 60% of the votes in many elections, they frequently lose due to questionable seat distributions. For instance, in the recent Haryana Assembly election, Congress lost 12% of seats despite only a 0.85% vote difference. Such anomalies are not isolated incidents but recurring patterns. The opposition's act of providing legitimacy to an illegitimate government elected through EVM fraud poses a serious threat to democracy.

## The Responsibility of Party Workers

Congress party workers, who pour their hearts into election campaigns, must realize that hard work alone cannot guarantee victory if the system itself is compromised. They must urge their leaders to confront the EVM issue head-on rather than remain in wishful thinking. A strong demand for transparency and accountability in the voting process is essential for fair elections.


Additionally, party workers need to challenge Rahul Gandhi to step out of the shadow of indecision and take concrete action against EVMs. If he continues to remain passive, they must not shy away from warning him of losing their support. Such a push could serve as a wake-up call for leadership, ensuring that the countless hours of effort and dedication by party workers translate into meaningful change, rather than being rendered futile by a compromised electoral system. Party workers must recognize their power to hold their leaders accountable and demand decisive action for the greater good of democracy.


## Time for Concrete Action

Rahul Gandhi should not merely pretend to emulate Mahatma Gandhi’s moral leadership; he must also take decisive actions to uphold democratic principles. Concrete steps are necessary—be it demanding a return to paper ballots, pushing for EVM audits, compiling all the 17C forms and making them public for scrutiny of ballot counts or rallying opposition parties to collectively address this pressing issue.

## Will Congress Truly Fight to Eliminate EVMs?

In a recent statement, Congress Chief Mallikarjun Kharge declared, "We don't want EVMs, we want ballot paper." While this sentiment aligns with growing concerns over EVM integrity, the real test lies in whether Congress is willing to fight tooth and nail to eliminate EVMs from the electoral process. Mere words are not enough—what's needed is sustained action, relentless advocacy, and political courage to challenge the system. The party must ensure it does not inadvertently become an accomplice to EVM fraud by failing to follow through on this stance. If Congress genuinely prioritizes democracy, it must lead a determined movement to restore the ballot paper system, rallying public support and forging a united opposition on this critical issue.

## The Imitation Game Movie and Its Relevance to EVM Concerns

The Imitation Game, a movie based on true events, depicts the incredible story of Alan Turing and his team at Bletchley Park during World War II. They succeeded in breaking the Nazi Enigma code, a cryptographic system thought to be unbreakable. However, their victory brought an unexpected challenge: they couldn’t use the decoded information to stop all enemy attacks. Doing so would alert the Germans that their code had been cracked, rendering the entire effort futile. To maintain secrecy, Turing's team had to make calculated decisions, allowing some attacks to occur to ensure the enemy didn’t suspect their encryption system had been compromised. As a result, while 70% of Allied ships were saved through strategic interventions, others were left to their fate to protect the greater mission—winning the war.

## Strategic Manipulation: The Plausible EVM Tactic

In a method strikingly similar to the Enigma strategy, the government may not be hacking EVM results across the board. Instead, they could be selectively targeting key states and constituencies with a larger number of seats while leaving a few smaller states or constituencies untouched. This calculated approach ensures plausible deniability, as it allows them to argue, "If EVMs are manipulated, how can the opposition win in these states?" By leaving room for some opposition victories, the public's suspicion is mitigated, and the system's legitimacy remains intact in the eyes of many. This selective interference could effectively tilt the balance of power while maintaining the illusion of fairness in the electoral process. Such a strategy, if true, would pose a grave threat to democracy by undermining its foundational principle of free and fair elections.

## Conclusion

As the leader of the opposition, Rahul Gandhi bears the responsibility to safeguard the nation’s democratic integrity. His reluctance to address EVM concerns undermines not only his leadership but also the trust of millions who look up to him. India deserves leaders who act decisively, especially on issues as fundamental as electoral integrity. Without urgent action, the future of democracy in the country remains at risk. It’s time for Rahul Gandhi to step up and take a firm stand—for his party, his nation, and democracy itself.
