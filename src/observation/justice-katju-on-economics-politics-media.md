## Can we attribute India's struggles solely to foreign influence? 

Renowned Justice Katju certainly believes so, directing blame towards external forces for the country's enduring poverty and challenges. While it may be tempting to seek simplistic explanations for complex issues, the reality is often more nuanced.

It is true that foreign companies, particularly large tech corporations, wield significant power over developing nations like India through their control of patents, intellectual property rights, and closed-source technology. Giants like Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and OpenAI dominate the digital landscape, influencing everything from economic decisions to the information we consume. Their influence extends to shaping our beliefs and values, often without us even realizing it. This concentration of power is indeed concerning and warrants scrutiny. Big tech companies facilitate the transfer of wealth from the general populace to a selected few, exacerbating the already severe income inequality.

Justice Katju's argument about polarization as a tool used by foreigners to destabilize developing countries also holds some merit. India, for instance, has become a hotbed of disinformation, with political parties, especially those in power, leveraging IT cells to disseminate misleading information through channels like WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. Governments often initiate disinformation campaigns, but it is the big tech companies that serve as their enablers and amplifiers. Through inadequate content moderation, the monetization of disinformation, and prioritizing engagement above all else, these tech giants allow misinformation to spread unchecked, akin to a wildfire raging out of control. However, it is essential to recognize that the responsibility for these actions lies primarily with our own government, judiciary and citizens. We must acknowledge that governments and citizens worldwide are equally susceptible to the manipulative tactics of big tech companies. **The struggle to curb their excessive power is a global one, and foreign citizens are just as much at the mercy of these corporations as we are**.

It is also worth noting that open-source technology, which offers an alternative to the dominance of big tech, has been championed by foreigners as well. While their efforts have not yet led to widespread success, it demonstrates that not all foreign influence is detrimental. Additionally, foreign journalists have played a crucial role in safeguarding our democracy when our mainstream media has often fallen short due to corporate influences.

In conclusion, while foreign influence may contribute to India's challenges, it is not the sole cause. The complex interplay of global powers, corporate interests, and domestic factors all shape the country's trajectory. Blaming foreigners alone oversimplifies the issue and distracts from the need for collective action to address the root causes of India's struggles.

## Are coalition governments inherently unstable?

It depends on the voting methodology and the rules governing the appointment of ministers and bureaucrat. Instability is not an inherent property of coalition governments.
