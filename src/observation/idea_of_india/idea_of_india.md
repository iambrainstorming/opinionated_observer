# The Idea of India is Under Threat — Only Unity Can Save It

The very idea of India — inclusive, democratic, and free — is under threat. If we truly want to preserve this vision, the opposition must come together and stand united.

Did our freedom fighters dream of a nation divided by religion? Did they sacrifice their lives so that our freedom of speech could be stripped away? Today, anyone who speaks out against the government is branded "anti-national." Artists and comedians who criticize through satire are silenced by mobs, while propaganda films are celebrated and promoted.

Religious festivals, which should symbolize harmony and joy, have turned into displays of superiority. Loud DJs and drunken dancing have replaced the spirit of devotion, leaving families too afraid to participate.

Is this the country we envisioned — where entrepreneurs and startups are choked by bureaucracy and corruption? Today, it seems impossible to run a business without paying bribes to officials and navigating a maze of red tape.

Do we want to live in a nation where the children of powerful industrialists exploit faith by propping up fraudulent godmen to spread superstition and religious hatred? Mainstream media plays along, giving them airtime and turning misinformation into headline news.

Do we want a judiciary that acts as a servant of the government — dysfunctional, intimidated, corrupt, and unable to protect our Constitution?

This is not the India our freedom fighters fought for. They never gave us freedom just to be ruled by mobs, gangsters, and fearmongers.

**United we stand, divided we fall.** In times of turmoil, unity is our greatest strength.

If the opposition truly wishes to protect the soul of India, they must come together — not for power, but for the very idea of India itself.
