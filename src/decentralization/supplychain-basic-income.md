# To Eliminate Poverty, We Need to Decentralize Supply Chains and Introduce Supply Chain-Based Basic Income

Poverty remains one of the most pressing challenges of our time, with its devastating effects on health, education, and overall quality of life. Recent reports highlight the severity of the issue in India, [where 36% of children under five are stunted, and 17% are underweight. States like Uttar Pradesh and Lakshadweep exhibit alarmingly high stunting rates of over 46%](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/36-children-aged-under-5-stunted-17-underweight-wcd-minister/article68449836.ece). Additionally, [anaemia affects 68.4% of children and 66.4% of women](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/health/anaemia-in-women-children-aggravated-in-2019-nfhs-5-74799), underscoring the dire need for nutritional interventions. Despite technological advancements in agriculture and food production, millions remain trapped in poverty, unable to access the resources they need to thrive. 

The root of the problem lies in the lack of money and the inability of impoverished communities to create sufficient demand for essential goods like food and nutrition. This demand-supply gap perpetuates a vicious cycle of poverty and malnutrition. To break this cycle, we must rethink our economic systems and leverage innovative solutions such as decentralized supply chains and supply chain-based basic income.

## The Problem: Poverty and the Demand-Supply Gap

Poverty is not merely a lack of resources; it is a systemic issue rooted in the inability of individuals to participate meaningfully in the economy. A recent study suggests that [poverty in India could be five times higher than government estimates, with 27.4% of the rural population and 23.7% of the urban population living below the poverty line](https://thewire.in/economy/indians-living-in-poverty-could-be-five-times-higher-than-govt-estimates-study). These individuals lack the purchasing power to buy nutritious food, which in turn discourages suppliers from catering to their needs. 

For instance, consider the case of biofloc fish cultivation, an innovative and environmentally friendly method of producing protein-rich fish. Despite its potential to address India's protein deficiency, biofloc cultivators struggle to make profits due to insufficient demand from low-income communities. This disconnect between supply and demand highlights the need for a new approach to poverty alleviation.

### The Solution: Decentralized Supply Chains and Supply Chain-Based Basic Income

To address this challenge, we must decentralize supply chains and introduce a supply chain-based basic income system. Here’s how this approach can work:

1. **Decentralization of Supply Chains**: 
   By decentralizing supply chains, we can empower local communities to produce and distribute essential goods like food, clothing, and medicine. Technologies such as precision farming, biofloc fish cultivation, and open-source software can enable small-scale producers to operate efficiently and sustainably. Decentralization reduces dependency on large corporations and ensures that resources are distributed equitably.

2. **Supply Chain-Based Basic Income**:
   A supply chain-based basic income involves providing individuals with a digital currency that can only be used to purchase specific goods within the supply chain. For example, a biofloc fish cultivator could receive cryptocurrency tokens that are exclusively redeemable for fish. This creates a guaranteed demand for the producer’s goods while ensuring that the basic income is spent on essential items.

3. **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**:
   DAOs can automate and streamline the logistics of decentralized supply chains. These blockchain-based organizations can track production, distribution, and consumption in real-time, ensuring transparency and efficiency. Incentives for producers and consumers can be automatically distributed through smart contracts, eliminating the need for intermediaries.

4. **Cryptocurrency and FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software)**:
   Cryptocurrencies can facilitate secure and transparent transactions within the supply chain. FOSS tools can provide the necessary infrastructure for managing decentralized systems, making them accessible to even the most marginalized communities. Together, these technologies can create a self-sustaining ecosystem that addresses both poverty and malnutrition.

### Case Study: Biofloc Fish Cultivation

Biofloc technology allows fish to be cultivated in controlled environments, making it an ideal solution for regions with limited access to natural water bodies. However, the high upfront costs and lack of demand from low-income communities have hindered its adoption. By decentralizing the biofloc supply chain and introducing a supply chain-based basic income, we can create a win-win situation:

- **For Producers**: Biofloc cultivators receive a steady income through cryptocurrency tokens, ensuring profitability and encouraging further investment in the technology.
- **For Consumers**: Low-income families gain access to affordable, protein-rich fish, improving their nutritional status and overall health.
- **For the Economy**: The local economy benefits from increased economic activity, job creation, and reduced dependency on external aid.

### The Broader Impact

A decentralized supply chain-based basic income system can address multiple dimensions of poverty:

- **Economic Empowerment**: By providing individuals with purchasing power, we can stimulate demand for essential goods and services, creating a self-sustaining economic ecosystem.
- **Nutritional Security**: Ensuring access to nutritious food can reduce stunting, underweight children, and anaemia, improving public health outcomes.
- **Environmental Sustainability**: Decentralized systems often rely on local resources and sustainable practices, reducing the environmental impact of production and distribution.
- **Social Equity**: By empowering marginalized communities, we can reduce inequality and promote social cohesion.

### Conclusion

Poverty is a complex and multifaceted issue, but it is not insurmountable. By decentralizing supply chains and introducing supply chain-based basic income, we can create a system that addresses both the symptoms and root causes of poverty. This approach leverages technology to empower individuals, stimulate demand, and ensure equitable access to essential resources. The time has come to rethink our economic systems and build a future where no one is left behind.
