## Why governments are desperate to ban cash and make people lose their right to withdraw it?

Public blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero) are a hope for financial freedom and censorship resistance.

The current price collapse is temporary; history shows public blockchains recover and grow over time.

on’t keep a large amount of your money in a bank account if you want to avoid arbitrary government censorship of your funds. Use a non-custodial crypto wallet. Diversify—hold some stablecoins, some Ethereum, and some gold-backed crypto.

Stay away from scammers in crypto. Educate yourself about cryptoeconomics. Quit Big Tech social media, where scammers thrive. 

Stay Safe.
