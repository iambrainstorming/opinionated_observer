# Its time to quit voting in Maharastra election

Your vote doesn't really matter. The evidence from data is clear: EVMs are being manipulated. As a result, voting has become a futile exercise. Unfortunately, the opposition has also failed to ensure election integrity. They often raise a ruckus for a day or two after losing an election, only to become silent afterwards. Moreover, opposition leaders are known to switch parties for personal gain, often in exchange for financial benefits. Therefore, it's pointless to vote for the opposition.

Institutional corruption has taken over, with the ECI and the Supreme Court failing to uphold the principles of democracy. It's better to boycott voting altogether and join the movement to end EVMs and FPTP.

Instead of resorting to violence, equip yourself with the strategies of non-violent struggle that our legacy of Mahatma Gandhi and Ambedkar has taught us. Learn about the weaknesses of EVMs and FPTP, and use that knowledge to your advantage. Make peaceful protests a part of your daily life. Stand up with placards, drums, and posters against EVMs and FPTP.

Remember, we the people give institutions their power. We can take it away at any time. So, let's rise up and reclaim our democracy.
