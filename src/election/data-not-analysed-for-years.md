# Why Has Election Commission Data Not Been Analyzed for Years? Why Are Universities Failing Us?

For over 15 years, questions around the integrity of India’s elections have persisted — from mismatches between votes polled and votes counted, to the authenticity of voter rolls riddled with duplicates and ghost voters. Yet, despite such a critical issue, there has been little to no systematic, public analysis of Election Commission of India (ECI) data. Why? The answer lies not just in institutional opacity, but also in the failure of India’s universities to produce the kind of skilled professionals needed to take on this task.

### The Data Problem: Locked Away in Non-Machine-Readable Formats

The ECI has consistently made electoral data available in formats that are deliberately unfriendly to analysis. Voter rolls are often published as scanned PDFs instead of structured, machine-readable files. This makes any meaningful cross-verification of votes — for instance, detecting duplicates across constituencies — extremely difficult without significant manual effort.

For over 15 years, no significant Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has successfully compelled the Election Commission to release data in a modern, analyzable format. Civil society organizations and independent researchers have raised concerns, but without structured access to the data, deep analysis remains impossible. The net effect: elections are shielded from the very scrutiny that ensures democracy’s credibility.

### Where Are the Developers and Statisticians?

Even when imperfect data is available, India has no shortage of talent on paper — millions of engineering graduates and thousands of data science professionals. Yet, hardly anyone takes on election data analysis as a public mission. Instead, most graduates are caught in the grind of corporate jobs, working to serve the interests of global tech companies rather than contributing to democratic accountability.

This isn’t simply a matter of individual choice. It reflects a deeper failure of India’s higher education system to cultivate civic responsibility, statistical literacy, and applied research skills among its graduates.

### The Incentive Gap: Why Students Don’t Build for the Public Good

Even when some students or young developers have the skills, they lack incentives to channel them into projects that serve the public interest. Building open-source tools for electoral analysis, environmental monitoring, or public health rarely earns recognition, funding, or career rewards.

Instead, students are trained to optimize for placements, multinational job offers, or short-term coding contests that prioritize speed over impact. The culture of innovation in Indian universities is thus skewed toward corporate employability rather than civic contribution.

Without scholarships, grants, or institutional support for public-good projects, talented individuals see little reason to spend their energy on analyzing election data — despite its critical role in safeguarding democracy.

### A Democratic Deficit

The absence of skilled, socially-driven professionals in this space has real consequences. Without independent verification and analysis, elections become a black box controlled solely by the Election Commission — with no external audit of its processes. This erodes public trust in democracy.

Meanwhile, countries with stronger civic-tech cultures regularly produce open-source election analysis projects, watchdog platforms, and transparent datasets. India, despite being a global IT powerhouse, has failed to mobilize its vast technical workforce for something as fundamental as safeguarding elections.

### The Way Forward

Fixing this gap requires a two-pronged approach:

1. **Data Transparency:** The Election Commission must be legally compelled to release all electoral data in machine-readable, standardized formats. A PIL demanding this is long overdue.

2. **University Reform:** Higher education institutions must be reoriented away from rote learning toward project-based, civic-oriented skill-building. Engineering and statistics curricula should integrate real-world governance datasets, including election data, into coursework.

3. **Public-Good Incentives:** Governments, universities, and civil society must create incentives — scholarships, grants, awards, and visibility — for students and developers who work on civic-tech projects. Until contributing to the public good becomes as rewarding as landing a corporate placement, the talent pipeline will continue to bypass critical democratic needs.

Until then, the mismatch between votes polled and counted, the existence of ghost voters, and the lack of independent scrutiny will remain festering wounds in India’s democracy — wounds that our universities and our Election Commission have both helped create.
