# Breaking the Trust on EVMs: Addressing the Awareness Problem Through Deep Canvassing

The Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) has been a cornerstone of India's voting process for several years. 

Voter turnout in India is comparable to other democracies, hovering around 50-60%, which necessarily indicates too much trust in the EVM system by the people.

In fact, it's a reflection of the general public's lack of awareness and understanding about the functioning and potential vulnerabilities of EVMs.

While we take pride in the act of voting—pressing the EVM button, flaunting our inked fingers, and sharing selfies on social media—the journey of our vote after that often escapes scrutiny. There is little concern or awareness about how our vote is counted, whether it aligns with the declared results, or if the process remains tamper-free.

## The Illusion of Trust in EVMs

The average citizen rarely questions the technology behind EVMs. In places like Markadwadi, a small village in Maharashtra, where some individuals question EVMs, the rest of the population remains indifferent or unaware. **Why don't every villagers ask questions against EVM?** This disparity highlights an awareness gap. Why do only a few question EVMs while the majority accept them without hesitation? The root cause lies in a lack of understanding, compounded by the illusion of trust in technological systems.

## Testing Public Knowledge and Misconception

Whoever it was tested on the quiz, they all got the answer to the security question wrong.

Which statement best describes the impact of secrecy on software security?

Open-source software exposes code to a wider range of attackers, increasing the risk of exploitation.

or

Secrecy is a liability, as it hinders the identification and patching of security flaws by a wider community of experts.

## No Knowledge about FOSS Philosophy

India, despite having a large production of computer science graduates, struggles with a lack of [FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) developers and a limited understanding of the benefits or freedom it offers](https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/programming/foss_philosophy.html). The majority of the population is non-technical, and many computer engineers end up working in companies like TCS or Infosys, producing proprietary software. Companies like Infosys whose cofounder Narayana Murthy demand 80-90 hours a week from employees who want to create wage slaves rather than critical thinkers.

## People Are Fed Manipulative Tactics with Simplistic Explanations

The question, “If EVMs are manipulated, how can the opposition win in these states?” is a rhetorical device designed to dismiss concerns about electoral fraud, offering a simplistic explanation that ignores the possibility of strategic manipulation.

The government may not be hacking EVM results across the board. Instead, they could be selectively targeting key states and constituencies with a larger number of seats while leaving a few smaller states or constituencies untouched. This calculated approach ensures plausible deniability, as it allows them to argue, "If EVMs are manipulated, how can the opposition win in these states?" By leaving room for some opposition victories, the public's suspicion is mitigated, and the system's legitimacy remains intact in the eyes of many.

## Deep Canvassing in Awareness: The Illusion of Explanatory Depth

[Deep Canvassing](https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/how-to-tackle-disinformation.html)

Psychological studies reveal that people often overestimate their understanding of systems, whether it’s a zipper, a toilet, or an EVM. When asked to explain these systems in detail, they quickly realize their knowledge gaps, prompting them to reevaluate their stance. The same principle applies to political and technological issues.


## Practical Application: Role of Teachers, Civil Society Members

Teachers, civil society members, and aware citizens must take the lead in initiating deep canvassing campaigns. By breaking down the mechanics of EVMs, highlighting potential vulnerabilities, and explaining why secrecy in software security is a liability, they can gradually dismantle the blind trust in EVMs.
