The False Equivalence: Why Comparing India’s Democratic Erosion to China’s One-Party System Is Deeply Misleading


## India Weakens Institutions, China Built Them Before Centralizing

India’s democratic backsliding is often compared to China’s centralized model. But while China spent decades building bureaucratic discipline, India today is hollowing out its institutional foundations. The Enforcement Directorate, Election Commission, media, civil society, and judiciary show growing executive influence. In contrast, China built a rule-bound—though authoritarian—bureaucratic ecosystem with layered oversight, audits, cadre evaluations, and internal discipline. India centralizes by dismantling institutions; China centralizes by reinforcing them. This is a fundamental divergence.

There is growing evidence that the BJP-led government in India has systematically undermined democratic institutions meant to serve as checks on executive power. From the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) being weaponized against political opponents, to the Election Commission of India (ECI) facing questions over impartiality, to the media being pressured through legal, financial, and social intimidation, the scaffolding of India’s democracy is under sustained assault. Civil society organizations face relentless scrutiny under foreign funding laws, while dissent is increasingly criminalized.

But this is not the consolidation of a stable authoritarian system like China’s—it is the degradation of a vibrant, if imperfect, democracy. India still holds elections, however skewed the playing field may become. Opposition parties still exist, however harassed. Courts still deliver inconvenient verdicts, however delayed. And millions still protest, however risky it may be.

China, by contrast, never had these democratic features to begin with. It is not “backsliding”—it is operating exactly as designed: a Leninist party-state where all authority flows from the Communist Party of China (CPC).


## China Has Internal Accountability; India Is Losing All Accountability

China lacks public accountability but has intense internal accountability mechanisms. Discipline commissions purge corrupt officials, rival factions monitor one another, and even top leaders remain vulnerable to sudden removal. In India, both public oversight and internal party checks are eroding. The PMO centralizes decision-making while institutions lose independence. The Chinese system restrains individuals through internal controls; the Indian system increasingly restrains no one. Thus, the classic warning about unchecked power applies far more to India’s trajectory.

**Why does “absolute power corrupts absolutely” NOT fully apply to China’s top leadership?**

**Because China’s leaders do NOT have absolute personal power. They have absolute *institutional* power — but inside that institution, they are surrounded by constant internal threats, surveillance, rivals, and performance expectations.**

So the quote fails because:

> **China’s leaders are not “absolute monarchs.” They are CEOs of a very dangerous corporation.**

A Chinese leader who becomes too corrupt **gets removed by other elites**, long before the public ever sees it.

---
**China’s rulers are powerful outside the Party, but fragile inside the Party.**

You must separate:

**1. Power over the public → almost absolute**
* No opposition
* No elections
* No free media
* No protests


**2. Power inside the CCP → extremely fragile**
* Faction rivals
* Elite networks
* Military generals
* Internal surveillance
* Discipline commission
* Political purges

A top leader is surrounded by people who can destroy him quietly.

This is why the quote “absolute power corrupts absolutely” doesn’t apply.

Because **China’s rulers don’t have absolute power within the system that matters: the Party itself.**


## China’s Leaders Emerge Through Competitive Bureaucracy; India’s Through Personalistic Politics

Rising in China’s system requires decades of administrative experience across provinces, annual performance reviews, audits, and scrutiny by multiple party bodies. It is authoritarian—but structured and meritocratic. India’s most powerful figures increasingly rise through ideological networks rather than administrative careers. Without competitive elite selection or internal evaluations, India’s emerging governance becomes more personalistic and vulnerable to collapse. China’s model is institutional authoritarianism; India’s trend is personalized electoral authoritarianism.

## India Is Drifting Toward Personality-Driven Rule, Not China’s Party-Driven System

China’s Communist Party is a 100‑million‑member organization with deep bureaucratic traditions. Its governance is centralized but institutional. India, however, is evolving toward a model where one party dominates elections, one leader dominates the party, the media is captured, civil society is suppressed, and oversight bodies lose independence. This is closer to Putin’s Russia or Erdoğan’s Turkey—not China. China’s model is stable; India’s emerging model is brittle and corruption-prone.


## China Built Bureaucratic Discipline Before Removing Elections—India Is Doing the Reverse

China’s political culture is rooted in long bureaucratic history: imperial exams, cadre evaluation, centralized planning, and Leninist structures. India’s political culture is rooted in pluralism, free media, civil society, and judicial independence. Removing democratic safeguards in India does not produce Chinese-style order. It produces a vacuum where no accountability—internal or external—remains. China removed free speech after building institutions; India is losing democratic freedoms without building alternative governance mechanisms.


India is not becoming China — it is becoming a democracy without guardrails.

A fragile system without the strengths of democracy or the efficiency of authoritarianism.

## Conclusion: Beware of Lazy Comparisons

Calling India “the next China” not only misdiagnoses the problem—it also lets the BJP off the hook. The threat in India isn’t the rise of a disciplined, self-regulating party-state. It’s the erosion of democratic norms by a ruling party that pays lip service to democracy while hollowing it out from within.

China’s system is authoritarian by design. India’s is democratic by constitution—but under siege. Conflating the two does a disservice to both: it whitewashes China’s repression by implying it’s just “another form of governance,” while it exaggerates India’s institutional collapse by suggesting it has already become a dictatorship.

The real danger in India isn’t that it will become China. It’s that it will become something far more dangerous: a democracy in name only, where elections persist but meaning evaporates, and where power is concentrated without accountability—internal or external.

That is a fate worse than authoritarianism, because it offers the illusion of choice without the substance of freedom. And it is uniquely India’s to confront.
