## Department No. 1: Racial or Religious Pride.

To mislead the laypeople, hateful messages will not work right from the start. The initial messages will focus on pride so that you get trapped in their trap.

You will be told that you should be proud of your race. 

"Look at how great we Hindus were. We knew everything. Our history is the greatest in the world. And our culture is the best culture in the world."

## Department No. 2: Victimisation and Self-Pity.

Once you are baptised with pride and arrogance, then you are made into a victim.
You get messages which tell you that Hindus have been t0rtured for centuries.

"Look at how we are a victim. These people have not let us succeed for thousands of years.
Once you start believing in it, the next to attack is Department #3.

## Department No. 3: You are in danger.

"Not only have you been tortured for centuries, but you are still in danger."

Every week, every day, you are showered with false messages.

"Look at this, they will k!ll you inside your homes." "Look at what happened there." "Look at how they killed the sadhus there." "It can happen to you someday."

And who are these people who are after you? They are the people of other religions. And every anti-BJP person are said to be supporting them.

Congress, Aam Aadmi Party, every opposition party, Left-wing, Urban Naxal, George Soros,Pakistan, China, the USA, Russia, all the international agencies are against you.

You are in danger. And when this fear is stuffed inside you, Department #4 will come to save you. Modi's cult of personality.

## Department No. 4: Modi's cult of personality

Who will save you? Modi ji will come and save you. Modi ji is our lord and saviour. WhatsApp messages will make you believe that Modi is not a human being.

He is Krishna and Ram incarnate. Right before any election, the third and fourth
departments are the most active.

You will get WhatsApp messages. If you want to save Hindus, then you should vote for BJP only.

To create justification, countless false narratives will be created.

So, once again, in short, let's understand the chronology.

Department #1, you are great because you are a Hindu. Department #2, you have been oppressed for centuries. Department #3, you are in danger. And Department 4, Modi and BJP will be the ones to save you.

The emotional roller coaster you are put through, pay attention to how dangerous it is. First the emotion of pride and arrogance, then self-pity, and then hatred and fear.
