Superb speech by IAS Officer Kannan Gopinathan! 👏 This is exactly how great leaders should stand their ground and tackle politicians with clarity and courage. 💪 #Leadership #Integrity #KannanGopinathan

The power of a simple "yes" or "no" often overshadows the complexity of critical decisions. Politicians skillfully frame questions to elicit blanket approval or rejection, glossing over nuanced details and potential consequences. For citizens, this can mean unknowingly endorsing policies or actions with far-reaching implications. When voters say "yes" without grasping the subtleties, they inadvertently empower decisions that might conflict with their best interests.
