Modi and his govt wants to convert India into North Korea.

North Korea is [a totalitarian dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea) with a comprehensive cult of personality around the Kim family. Amnesty International considers the country to have the worst human rights record in the world. Officially, North Korea is an "independent socialist state" which holds democratic elections; however, outside observers have described the elections as unfair, uncompetitive, and pre-determined, in a manner similar to elections in the Soviet Union.
