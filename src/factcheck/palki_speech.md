# Palki Sharma Three Arguments



Palki Sharma presents three arguments on development.

## Financial Inclusion

According to her, paying through UPI is considered development. However, it's actually a dangerous move. It's about relinquishing control of your finances to the government, enabling them to seize your account anytime there's protest or dissent. Thousands of bank accounts have already been blocked by the government, including those of the Congress Party.

Cash is still very easy to use, but the government has undermined the cash system through measures such as demonetization, which has [adversely affected the livelihoods of millions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176518302143)


Can poor and middle-class people bear the burden of maintaining a minimum balance?

## Internet or digital penetration

While during Congress's tenure, there were more than 12 service providers, under the new Modi government, the number has dwindled to two or three. None of them offer optimal service; Airtel is somewhat better, but Jio is worse. The government seems to prioritize corporate profits and foster monopolies. As for digital penetration, the credit should be attributed to cheaper mobiles from China rather than Modi's India.

## Airport Traffic

Is airport traffic a good thing? In a country where 90% of the population belongs to the middle class, air travel is hardly accessible. Moreover, it's one of the biggest contributors to pollution, especially in the era of climate change. During summer, heat waves last for two months, with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius. What we truly need is investment in [public transport](https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/road-planning-of-cities.html), which is currently lacking. Instead, Modi's focus seems to be on building roads for a car-centric system, leading to pollution and traffic congestion that harm our ecosystem.

# Fake journalist tries to control the stories, true journalist shows facts.

"When you set the NARRATIVE, and when you are in control of the STORY, you can project yourself as a GOOD BOY, inspite of all the WRONG you did, That's where the MEDIA comes in"
