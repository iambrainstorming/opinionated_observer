# The Hindutva Brigade Wants you to Believe in Eugenics not Evolution

The Hindutva brigade wants you to believe in eugenics—that we are inherently different from people of other religions, and that our religion is genetically superior.
They peddle a dangerous myth of biological hierarchy dressed in spiritual nationalism.
Driven by superstition and pseudoscience, they actively oppose scientific education, especially evolutionary biology, because it dismantles their false narratives.
They fear evolution not because it's wrong, but because it reveals an undeniable truth: we are all connected, and no group is born superior.

The Hindutva brigade, along with complicit religious gurus, seeks to treat followers of other religions—particularly Muslims and Christians—as second or even third-class citizens.
They have launched a calculated cultural and ideological war, fueling communal tensions and disrupting the secular fabric of the nation.
From absurdly labeling soft drinks like Rooh Afza and brands like Himalaya as part of a so-called "jihad," to glorifying and garlanding convicted criminals who have spent decades in prison for murdering people of other faiths—they are actively normalizing hate.
This is not nationalism. It is a dangerous, divisive agenda aimed at erasing coexistence and rewriting morality to serve bigotry.

While some factions, like the self-styled Hindutva brigade, push regressive narratives rooted in superiority complexes, it’s critical to lay bare the truth: there is no scientific basis for genetic superiority between religions, and modern molecular evolution explains why.

## What Is Evolution—Really?

Evolution is not a belief system. It’s a scientific framework grounded in evidence that explains how life changes over time through natural selection, genetic drift, mutations, and other mechanisms. It's not about monkeys turning into humans overnight—it’s about how small genetic changes accumulate over generations, giving rise to new species and traits.

Charles Darwin laid the groundwork with On the Origin of Species (1859), but today, molecular evolution goes even deeper. By examining DNA, RNA, and proteins across species, scientists now understand how genetic changes occur at the molecular level, how traits are inherited, and how diversity arises naturally—not divinely or politically.


## Modern Molecular Evolution: The Scientific Truth

### DNA is Universal

All life shares the same genetic building blocks—DNA. Whether you're human, a tree, or a bacterium, your genetic code is made of the same molecules. This is powerful evidence for common ancestry, not divine segregation by religion.

### Mutations Drive Diversity

Random mutations in DNA happen during replication. Some are harmful, some neutral, and a few beneficial. Over time, natural selection favors traits that help organisms survive and reproduce. That’s how traits spread—not through caste, not through rituals, and certainly not through superiority myths.

### Mitochondrial DNA and Y-Chromosome Studies

Genetic studies have traced human ancestry to common ancestors in Africa. There's no "pure" race, caste, or religion. The idea of genetic superiority based on religion is scientifically illiterate.

### Horizontal Gene Transfer & Genetic Mixing

Especially in bacteria and early life forms, genes don’t always follow straight inheritance. They jump across species. Even in humans, gene flow between populations (through migration and interbreeding) increases genetic fitness, not "pollution" as extremists falsely claim.

### Eugenics: A Dangerous Lie

Eugenics—the idea of breeding “better” humans—is a debunked and morally bankrupt ideology that led to atrocities like the Holocaust. Attempts to revive it under religious or cultural pretexts are both unscientific and genocidal. Genetics does not work like that. Intelligence, health, and behavior are influenced by a complex interplay of genes and environment, not religious background.


### Why the Hindutva Obsession with Pseudoscience?

The Hindutva movement thrives on mythology as history, astrology as astronomy, and ritual as biology. They’ve opposed teaching evolution, fearing that it challenges their narrative of divine origin and caste-based hierarchy. But reality doesn’t care about ideology. Removing evolution from the curriculum doesn’t make it less true—it makes future generations less informed, less critical, and more vulnerable to manipulation.

### Science Is Universal. Religion Is Not.

Science invites questions, evidence, and debate. It doesn't need you to bow, chant, or believe. It needs you to observe, test, and understand. Evolution explains how we are all connected, not how we are divided. Molecular biology confirms that we are variations of the same species, shaped by time, adaptation, and chance—not chosen by gods.

### Final Word

The Holocaust under Nazi leader Adolf Hitler did not happen simply because people were unaware—it happened because too many chose to remain silent. Indifference, fear, and apathy paved the way for one of the darkest chapters in human history. Today, despite tremendous scientific and technological progress, history is beginning to echo itself. Fascism is tightening its grip on this country, cloaked in nationalism and moral decay. The warning signs are all around us—intolerance, propaganda, silencing of dissent, and the demonization of minorities. **Now is not the time for silence. It is time to resist, to speak out, and to fight fascism with everything we have—** with truth, courage, and unyielding conviction.
