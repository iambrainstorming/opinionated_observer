# How much money is required for the surgeries in Odisha per year?

## Is Ayushman Bharat merely a gimmick?

A total of 4642 surgeries were performed per year for a population of 88,273. Cataract (22.8%), Caesareans (3.8%), surgeries for fractures (3.27%) and hernia (2.86%) were the commonest surgeries. 44.2% of surgeries belonged to the essential surgeries. [We estimated 3646 surgeries would be required per 100,000 Indian population per year.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7752785/) One-third of these surgeries would be needed for the age group 30–49 years, in the Indian population.

Odisha population: 46,953,000

Total surgeries required per years: 46,953,000/100,000 * 3646  = 1711906 surgeries

If we take average price of surgery as ₹100,000, the total cost of surgeries would be = ₹171,190,600,000 = ₹ 1.7119 * 10^11

GDP of odisha = ₹10.63 lakh crore = ₹ 10.63 * 100,000 * 10,000,000 = ₹ 1.063×10^13

**It requres 1.61 % of GDP to cover the cost of surgeries.**

[Odisha’s total own tax revenue is estimated to be Rs 53,000 crore in 2023-24.](https://prsindia.org/budgets/states/odisha-budget-analysis-2023-24
)

Total tax revenue Odisha = ₹ 530,000,000,000 = ₹ 5.3 * 10^11

**It requires 32.3% of Tax revenue for surgeries.**


## Conclusion

It requires 32.3% of tax revenue to fund surgeries in Odisha. Can the government afford to spend such a large portion of tax on surgeries alone? Additionally, there are other costs, such as medicines, diagnostics, and post-operative care—are not even included. Government, please stop misleading the people.

The government cannot sustain Ayushman Bharat—it is merely a gimmick. It would be better for the government to focus on strengthening public healthcare, making it more robust and affordable, rather than spending taxpayers' money to support expensive private healthcare. This approach would ensure that the majority of people benefit.
