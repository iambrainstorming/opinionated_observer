# The Supreme Court of India: Supreme Corruption Institution?

The Supreme Court of India, often lauded as the guardian of the Constitution, has recently come under fire for decisions that critics claim prioritize institutional opacity over transparency and dismiss critical debates with rhetoric instead of evidence-based reasoning. These accusations raise pertinent questions about the judiciary’s role in maintaining democratic accountability.


## The Case of Hidden Data: A Blow to Electoral Transparency

One of the most glaring controversies involves the Supreme Court’s refusal to release polling station-wise voter turnout data (Form 17C). The Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) argued that such data could help address discrepancies of 5-6% between initial and final turnout figures, enhancing electoral transparency. However, the Supreme Court denied this request, citing logistical challenges and potential misuse of data.

> This decision has drawn sharp criticism. How can data lead to misuse? Transparency advocates argue that data, in itself, cannot inherently lead to misuse—it serves as the foundation for accountability and transparency. Denying public access to such critical information fosters suspicions of electoral malpractice and fuels distrust in democratic institutions.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) defended its stance, claiming that Form 17C data is already accessible to candidates’ agents, implying a check is in place. However, making such data public would allow independent audits, fostering confidence in electoral processes. By refusing, the court appears to have undermined its own mandate to uphold transparency.

## EVM Debate: Science Dismissed, Whataboutism Adopted

The debate over the reliability of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) is another example where the Supreme Court faced criticism for its handling of concerns. In response to a petition advocating a return to paper ballots, the court dismissed the plea with a sweeping generalization: "When you win the election, EVMs are not tampered with. When you lose, they are tampered with."

Such remarks trivialize serious concerns raised by cryptographers and computer science experts globally. Most computer science and cryptography experts agree that no electronic system is entirely immune to manipulation. Internationally, many nations have reverted to paper ballots or adopted verifiable hybrid systems to enhance electoral integrity.

Instead of engaging with evidence or expert analysis on EVM vulnerabilities, the court resorted to rhetorical deflections. 

After Paul revealed he had been to over 150 countries, the bench asked him whether each of the nations had ballot paper voting or used electronic voting.

The petitioner said foreign countries had adopted ballot paper voting and India should follow suit.

The strange answer:

"Why don't you want to be different from the rest of the world?" asked the bench.

What it can be interpreted is:

> So, if other countries are not committing election fraud, only India is different because it conducts election fraud. That is a great achievement for the country because India is, indeed, different.

## Judicial Accountability: A Growing Concern. Can we trust judiciary?

These instances point to a broader issue: the Supreme Court’s unwillingness to engage transparently and scientifically with matters of public concern. Critics argue that the judiciary is increasingly shielded from scrutiny, with decisions reflecting institutional convenience rather than constitutional principles.

Transparency and accountability are the cornerstones of democracy. Whether it is electoral data or the integrity of voting systems, the judiciary has a responsibility to lead by example. By refusing to embrace transparency and dismissing scientific arguments, the Supreme Court risks eroding public trust—a danger that no democracy can afford.
