# Internet Shutdown is Anti-Constitutional

The internet shutdown has become a widespread issue in India, persisting for months and weeks, particularly in states governed by the government in power, such as Jammu and Kashmir and Manipur, as well as districts like Bhadrak and Balasore in Odisha. This has become a very concerning trend, and civil society, along with the people of India, should fight for the fundamental rights that are being compromised.

The shutdown of the internet is considered anti-constitutional as it infringes upon the fundamental rights of citizens, including the right to freedom of expression and the right to livelihood.

## Proprietary Based Meta Services

We don't need proprietary software from companies like Facebook or Meta, which the community cannot modify or customize based on their needs and well-being. This is undemocratic because it doesn't provide the freedom that the Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) community fights for.

Instead of banning Facebook and meta services, why the government is banning the whole internet?

## Government's Intentions Behind the Spread of Disinformation

However, the ruling government does not seem to be interested in stopping the spread of disinformation or communal disharmony on the internet. Instead, it appears that they want to compete with other political parties to spread disinformation, in order to remain ahead and maintain control over the narrative. This way, the public may not receive authentic news about the government's actions, and the government can avoid being held accountable.

One can infer the government's intentions from the fact that India has become [number one in the spread of disinformation](https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/how-to-tackle-disinformation.html). The government is attempting to control online critics by introducing a [broadcasting bill](../information/broadcast_bill.md), using godi media for propaganda, and [funding influencers who consistently portray the government in a positive light (Uttar Pradesh Broadcasting bill)](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uttar-pradesh/uttar-pradesh-brings-digital-media-policy-pushes-promotion-of-government-schemes-achievements/article68576759.ece). Additionally, the government is employing paid troll sybil attacks on social media to spread hatred among communities.

Censoring the internet is another way for the government to maintain its control over the population. This message from an authoritarian government sends a chilling warning: if you dare to protest, you will face the consequences. We will revoke your freedom of expression and your right to a livelihood.

## Internet a fundamental right

The internet is a fundamental right. It is not a tool for making reels and spreading fake information or information pollution, which is what big tech companies are often doing.

Instead, the internet is essential for creative discourse, discussing democratic issues, serving journalists and civil societies, facilitating education and learning, and promoting e-commerce. 

## Internet for livelihoods

The internet shutdown is a draconian measure that constitutes a direct attack on the livelihoods of countless individuals. By disabling online access, governments are effectively severing the economic lifelines of cities and town who rely on the internet for their daily work.

From entrepreneurs and small business owners to freelancers and remote workers, the internet has become an indispensable tool for earning a living in the modern economy.

With internet ban, people can't make online bank transfers, nor can they make purchases online.


## Corporate Monopoly of the Internet

The current state of the internet is characterized by a corporate monopoly, where only a few internet service providers (ISPs) dominate the market. This concentration of power makes it remarkably easy for the executive branch to shut down the internet, which is a clear abuse of power.

In contrast to a resilient, decentralized internet, the oligopoly model is highly detrimental to our democracy. It has the potential to slide our country into an authoritarian regime, as oligarchs control the flow of information, stifling free speech and dissent.


## Role of the Supreme Court

The Supreme Court's silence regarding the internet ban is depressing and poses a significant threat to democracy. The Supreme Court plays a crucial role in checking the arbitrary powers of the executive branch. In today's modern age, the internet has become a fundamental right. The executive cannot simply snatch away citizens' civil liberties by shutting down the internet, which not only hurts the economy but also infringes upon the fundamental right to earn a livelihood, thereby violating the principles of constitutional governance.
