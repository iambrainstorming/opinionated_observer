# Stubble Burning is a Distraction

Stubble burning is a distraction used to protect the corporate lobby, including factories that burn coal and the car industry. The lobby is so influential that no institute will dare to publish the actual data of Indian industries causing pollution.

Even if Indian data is obscured, global data clearly shows that the [coal and fossil fuel industries](https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/invest_on_renewables.html), along with the [transportation especially car industry](https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/road-planning-of-cities.html), are the largest polluters.

Also [creating green spaces and green cities](https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/building-better-cities.html) is essential for tackling pollution and improving urban living conditions.

Politicians must stop misleading the public and address the real causes of pollution. [Incidents like Hasdeo](../justice/police-loyality.md), where police force was employed to facilitate coal industry expansion through deforestation, represent a profound betrayal of public trust. Such actions prioritize corporate interests over the health and well-being of citizens, effectively signing a death sentence for millions. India already leads the world in pollution-related deaths, a tragic statistic that underscores the urgent need for honest, sustainable policy decisions. Only by confronting the true sources of pollution can politicians protect public health and build a cleaner, safer future.
