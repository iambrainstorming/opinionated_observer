# Stubble Burning is a Distraction

Stubble burning is a distraction used to protect the corporate lobby, including factories that burn coal and the car industry. The lobby is so influential that no institute will dare to publish the actual data of Indian industries causing pollution.

Even if Indian data is obscured, global data clearly shows that the [coal and fossil fuel industries](https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/invest_on_renewables.html), along with the [transportation especially car industry](https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/road-planning-of-cities.html), are the largest polluters.

Also [creating green spaces and green cities](https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/building-better-cities.html) is essential for tackling pollution and improving urban living conditions.



[The top 7 most polluting industries in 2024](https://www.theecoexperts.co.uk/blog/top-7-most-polluting-industries)

- The energy (fossil fuels) industry is the most polluting industry in the world
- The transport industry is the second most-polluting industry in the world

Politicians must stop misleading the public and address the real causes of pollution. [Incidents like Hasdeo](../justice/police-loyality.md), where police force was employed to facilitate coal industry expansion through deforestation, represent a profound betrayal of public trust. Such actions prioritize corporate interests over the health and well-being of citizens, effectively signing a death sentence for millions. India already leads the world in pollution-related deaths, a tragic statistic that underscores the urgent need for honest, sustainable policy decisions. Only by confronting the true sources of pollution can politicians protect public health and build a cleaner, safer future.



## Pollution Isn't Just a One-Day Issue: The Year-Round Impact of the Fossil Fuel Industry

During Diwali, families and children are often discouraged from celebrating due to heightened pollution levels, and many Delhi residents even leave the city to escape the toxic air. With pollution present year-round, even a small increase becomes intolerable, impacting daily life and health. It’s crucial to recognize the primary causes of this pollution—namely, the fossil fuel and car industries—rather than focusing solely on a single-day celebration like Diwali. Affordable and efficient solar panels are now widely available and could replace fossil fuel industries, significantly reducing emissions. Additionally, we need to rethink urban design: rather than cities congested with cars that create traffic and occupy vast spaces, we should prioritize bike-friendly, pedestrian-oriented green cities. Shifting towards renewable energy and sustainable urban planning can make our cities healthier, cleaner, and safer for future generations.

> If you truly care about your children's future, it's time to stand against fossil fuels. Let’s ensure they inherit a world where they can breathe freely and live safely.
