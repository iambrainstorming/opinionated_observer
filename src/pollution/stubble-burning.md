# Stubble Burning is a Distraction to pollution problem

Update: 10-11-2025


Stubble burning is a distraction used to protect the corporate lobby, including factories that burn coal and the car industry. The lobby is so influential that no institute will dare to publish the actual data of Indian industries causing pollution.

Even if Indian data is obscured, global data clearly shows that the [coal and fossil fuel industries](https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/invest_on_renewables.html), along with the [transportation especially car industry](https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/road-planning-of-cities.html), are the largest polluters.

Also [creating green spaces and green cities](https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/building-better-cities.html) is essential for tackling pollution and improving urban living conditions.



[The top 7 most polluting industries in 2024](https://www.theecoexperts.co.uk/blog/top-7-most-polluting-industries)

- The energy (fossil fuels) industry is the most polluting industry in the world
- The transport industry is the second most-polluting industry in the world

Politicians must stop misleading the public and address the real causes of pollution. [Incidents like Hasdeo](../justice/police-loyality.md), where police force was employed to facilitate coal industry expansion through deforestation, represent a profound betrayal of public trust. Such actions prioritize corporate interests over the health and well-being of citizens, effectively signing a death sentence for millions. India already leads the world in pollution-related deaths, a tragic statistic that underscores the urgent need for honest, sustainable policy decisions. Only by confronting the true sources of pollution can politicians protect public health and build a cleaner, safer future.

## CREA Report
Meanwhile, [a study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA)](https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/metro/delhi/other-news/delhi-ncr-pollution-main-causes-thermal-power-plants-polluting-more-than-stubble-burning/articleshow/115391931.cms) has been revealed. The study revealed that thermal power plants in NCR spread 16 times more air pollution than stubble burning. The highest pollution is caused by thermal power plants According to the study of CREA, "The thermal power plants in Delhi-NCR spread 16 times more pollution than the 17.8 kiloton pollution emitted from 89 lakh tonnes of stubble burning. The study said that between June 2022 and May 2023, coal-fired thermal power plants in NCR released 281 kiloton of sulphur dioxide (SO2).

## India is the largest SO2 emitting country
India is currently the worlds largest SO2 emitter. It is responsible for more than 20% of global anthropogenic SO2 emissions. This is mainly due to its coal-dependent energy sector.

## Most SO2 coming out of thermal power plant
The study found that the comparison between NCR thermal power plant emissions and stubble burning emissions in Punjab and Haryana highlights the scale of SO2 pollution. Thermal power plants in NCR emit 281 kilotons of SO2 annually, which is 16 times more than the 17.8 kilotons emitted from 89 lakh tonnes of stubble burning.



## Pollution Isn't Just a One-Day Issue: The Year-Round Impact of the Fossil Fuel Industry

During Diwali, families and children are often discouraged from celebrating due to heightened pollution levels, and [many Delhi residents even leave the city to escape the toxic air](https://scroll.in/article/1074991/why-some-delhi-residents-leave-the-city-during-diwali). With pollution present year-round, even a small increase becomes intolerable, impacting daily life and health. It’s crucial to recognize the primary causes of this pollution—namely, the fossil fuel and car industries—rather than focusing solely on a single-day celebration like Diwali. Affordable and efficient solar panels are now widely available and could replace fossil fuel industries, significantly reducing emissions. However, the government is not taking sufficient measures to promote rooftop, community-owned power generation through solar panels; instead, they remain focused on appeasing the fossil fuel industry. Additionally, we need to rethink urban design: rather than cities congested with cars that create traffic and occupy vast spaces, we should prioritize bike-friendly, pedestrian-oriented green cities. Shifting towards renewable energy and sustainable urban planning can make our cities healthier, cleaner, and safer for future generations.

> If you truly care about your children's future, it's time to stand against fossil fuels. Let’s ensure they inherit a world where they can breathe freely and live safely. Please don't complain about power outages or the inability to drive cars.

**Consider installing solar panels, requesting free of cost installation, using public transportation, and riding electric bikes to help reduce pollution.**
