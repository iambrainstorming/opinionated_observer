# Banning Cars to Tackle Pollution: A Must, But Intentions Matter More

India is once again at a policy crossroads, where the public narrative claims to focus on tackling air pollution and traffic congestion. Under the new directive, petrol vehicles older than 15 years and diesel vehicles older than 10 years will no longer be allowed to refuel or operate on public roads. On the surface, this sounds like a much-needed measure to curb urban air pollution and improve public health. But as with many government decisions in recent years, the public is questioning the true intentions behind these policies. Are these actions genuinely aimed at saving the environment, or are they cleverly disguised attempts to boost profits for the automobile industry?

### Banning Old Vehicles: Solution or Sales Boost?

The logic behind banning older petrol and diesel vehicles is simple — older engines are often less efficient and emit higher levels of pollutants. But the real question is, why stop at just banning old vehicles? Why are governments not taking stronger steps to reduce vehicle dependency altogether? If pollution is truly the concern, wouldn't it be more effective to ban private cars from crowded city centers entirely, promote public transport, and convert urban zones into low-emission, pedestrian-friendly spaces?

What seems to be unfolding is a pattern — restrict old vehicles, but indirectly push citizens to purchase new ones. And these new vehicles, whether petrol, diesel, or even electric, bring in huge profits for car manufacturers. This creates an artificial demand for cars under the guise of environmental protection.

### Trust Deficit: History of Questionable Policies

The skepticism isn’t unfounded. In recent years, India has witnessed multiple policy moves that have raised more questions than answers. From the chaotic demonetization exercise that promised to curb black money but left ordinary people struggling, to divisive moves like the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that sparked nationwide protests, trust in political decision-making has eroded.

Even the foundation of democracy — elections — remains under suspicion with the persistent use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), which lack transparency. Against this backdrop of manipulation and misinformation, citizens are justified in questioning whether this vehicle ban is truly for public welfare or just another staged act to benefit select industries.

## Millions Are Dying — Tackling Pollution is Non-Negotiable

While the intentions behind such policies may be questionable, one harsh reality cannot be ignored — [millions are dying due to air pollution every year](https://hsph.harvard.edu/environmental-health/news/air-pollution-in-india-linked-to-millions-of-deaths/). Major Indian cities repeatedly rank among the most polluted in the world, with toxic air cutting lives short, causing respiratory diseases, heart problems, and other severe health conditions. Tackling air pollution is not a luxury or an optional policy debate — it is a life-and-death necessity.

Inaction is no longer an option. But action needs to be meaningful, comprehensive, and free from hidden agendas. Half-baked solutions that only serve corporate interests will not save lives — they will only delay real progress.

### What a Real Anti-Pollution Policy Looks Like

If the aim is to genuinely tackle pollution and reduce traffic, policy measures need to go beyond targeting old vehicles. The focus should be on:

* **Banning Cars from City Centers:** [As seen in several Nordic countries, restricting cars from entering central urban areas significantly reduces air pollution and improves the quality of life](https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/road-planning-of-cities.html).

* **Creating Low-Emission Zones:** Instead of just removing old vehicles, designate entire neighborhoods or cities as low-emission zones, where only public transport, cycles, and pedestrians are allowed.

* **Stop the Sale of New Cars:** Bold policies should even consider halting the sale of new private vehicles, including Electric Vehicles (EVs), unless accompanied by strict traffic reduction plans. Otherwise, [even EVs will only worsen traffic congestion and urban chaos](https://iambrainstorming.github.io/chapters/public_transport/ev_not_solution.html).

* **Shift to Public Transport:** Invest heavily in public transportation such as metro rail, buses, and light rail systems, making them affordable, accessible, and efficient.

* **Two-Wheeler Transition:** While bikes are essential for daily commuting, they should transition to electric models. Petrol-based two-wheelers still contribute to air and noise pollution, especially in densely populated cities.

### The Profit Motive Behind Greenwashing

Without regulating overall car dependency, the policy risks becoming another form of greenwashing — promoting so-called eco-friendly vehicles while conveniently boosting car sales.

It’s essential to separate genuine environmental action from policies designed to enrich corporate lobbies under the guise of fighting pollution. Banning older vehicles is not enough; without broader structural changes, this is just a clever rerouting of consumer spending back to the automobile industry.

### Conclusion: We Need Genuine, Not Cosmetic, Change

Tackling air pollution and traffic requires more than token gestures. Citizens should demand policies that put people and the environment first, not profits. This includes car-free zones, restrictions on private vehicle sales, improved public transport, and full transparency in political decision-making.

Until then, every new policy — no matter how green it sounds — deserves scrutiny. In a land where even elections are doubted, the public cannot afford to blindly trust leaders who often serve industry interests over public welfare. It's time for citizens to stay alert, question intentions, and push for real solutions that benefit both people and the planet.
